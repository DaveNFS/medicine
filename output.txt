alternative-medicine


<p>Alternative forms of therapy can be integrated into your regular health plan to help you deal with the signs and symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome. You may have to experiment to find a treatment that works for you. Still, always check with your doctor before trying any complementary or alternative treatment.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Yoga.</strong> Yoga postures designed for strengthening, stretching and balancing each joint in the upper body, as well as the upper body itself, may help reduce the pain and improve the grip strength of people with carpal tunnel syndrome.</li>
    <li><strong>Hand therapy.</strong> Preliminary evidence suggests that certain physical and occupational hand therapy techniques may help improve symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome.</li>
    <li><strong>Ultrasound therapy.</strong> High-intensity ultrasound can be used to raise the temperature of a targeted area of body tissue to reduce pain and promote healing. A course of ultrasound therapy over several weeks may help improve the symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome.</li>
</ul>



symptoms


<p>Carpal tunnel syndrome usually starts gradually with numbness or tingling in your thumb, index and middle fingers that comes and goes. This may be associated with discomfort in your wrist and hand. Common carpal tunnel syndrome symptoms include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p><strong>Tingling or numbness.</strong> You may experience tingling and numbness in your fingers or hand, especially your thumb and index, middle or ring fingers, but not your little finger. This sensation often occurs while holding a steering wheel, phone or newspaper or, commonly, waking you from sleeping. The sensation may extend from your wrist up your arm.</p>
    <p>Many people "shake out" their hands to try to relieve their symptoms. As the disorder progresses, the numb feeling may become constant.</p>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Weakness.</strong> You may experience weakness in your hand and a tendency to drop objects. This may be due to the numbness in your hand or weakness of the thumb's pinching muscles, which are controlled by the median nerve.</li>
</ul>
<h3>When to see a doctor</h3>
<p>If you have persistent signs and symptoms suggestive of carpal tunnel syndrome, especially if they interfere with your normal activities and sleep patterns, see your doctor. If you leave the condition untreated, permanent nerve and muscle damage can occur.</p>



risk-factors


<p>A number of factors have been associated with carpal tunnel syndrome. Although by themselves they don't cause carpal tunnel syndrome, they may increase your chances of developing or aggravating median nerve damage. These include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p><strong>Anatomic factors.</strong> A wrist fracture or dislocation that alters the space within the carpal tunnel can create extraneous pressure on the median nerve.</p>
    <p>People with smaller carpal tunnels may be more likely to have carpal tunnel syndrome.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p><strong>Sex.</strong> Carpal tunnel syndrome is generally more common in women. This may be because the carpal tunnel area is relatively smaller than in men, and there may be less room for error.</p>
    <p>Women who have carpal tunnel syndrome may also have smaller carpal tunnels than women who don't have the condition.</p>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Nerve-damaging conditions.</strong> Some chronic illnesses, such as diabetes, increase your risk of nerve damage, including damage to your median nerve. </li>
    <li><strong>Inflammatory conditions.</strong> Illnesses that are characterized by inflammation, such as rheumatoid arthritis, can affect the tendons in your wrist, exerting pressure on your median nerve.</li>
    <li><strong>Alterations in the balance of body fluids.</strong> Fluid retention, common during pregnancy or menopause, may increase the pressure within your carpal tunnel, irritating the median nerve. Carpal tunnel syndrome associated with pregnancy generally resolves on its own after pregnancy.</li>
    <li><strong>Other medical conditions.</strong> Certain conditions, such as menopause, obesity, thyroid disorders and kidney failure, may increase your chances of carpal tunnel syndrome.</li>
    <li>
    <p><strong>Workplace factors.</strong> It's possible that working with vibrating tools or on an assembly line that requires prolonged or repetitive flexing of the wrist may create harmful pressure on the median nerve or worsen existing nerve damage.</p>
    <p>However, the scientific evidence is conflicting and these factors haven't been established as direct causes of carpal tunnel syndrome.</p>
    <p>Several studies have evaluated whether there is an association between computer use and carpal tunnel syndrome. However, there has not been enough quality and consistent evidence to support extensive computer use as a risk factor for carpal tunnel syndrome, although it may cause a different form of hand pain.</p>
    </li>

prevention


<p>There are no proven strategies to prevent carpal tunnel syndrome, but you can minimize stress on your hands and wrists by taking the following precautions:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Reduce your force and relax your grip.</strong> Most people use more force than needed to perform many manual tasks. If your work involves a cash register, for instance, hit the keys softly. For prolonged handwriting, use a big pen with an oversized, soft grip adapter and free-flowing ink. This way you won't have to grip the pen tightly or press as hard on the paper.</li>
    <li><strong>Take frequent breaks.</strong> Give your hands and wrists a break by gently stretching and bending them periodically. Alternate tasks when possible. If you use equipment that vibrates or that requires you to exert a great amount of force, taking breaks is even more important.</li>
    <li><strong>Watch your form.</strong> Avoid bending your wrist all the way up or down. A relaxed middle position is best. If you use a keyboard, keep it at elbow height or slightly lower.</li>
    <li><strong>Improve your posture.</strong> Incorrect posture can cause your shoulders to roll forward. When your shoulders are in this position, your neck and shoulder muscles are shortened, compressing nerves in your neck. This can affect your wrists, fingers and hands.</li>
    <li><strong>Keep your hands warm.</strong> You're more likely to develop hand pain and stiffness if you work in a cold environment. If you can't control the temperature at work, put on fingerless gloves that keep your hands and wrists warm.</li>
</ul>



lifestyle-home-remedies


<p>These steps may help you gain at least temporary relief from your symptoms:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Take quick breaks from repetitive activities involving the use of your hands.</li>
    <li>Rotate your wrists and stretch your palms and fingers.</li>
    <li>Take a pain reliever, such as aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) or naproxen (Aleve).</li>
    <li>Wear a wrist splint at night. Wrist splints are generally available over-the-counter at most drugstores or pharmacies. The splint should be snug but not tight.</li>
    <li>Avoid sleeping on your hands to help ease the pain or numbness in your wrists and hands.</li>
</ul>
<p>If pain, numbness or weakness recurs and persists, see your doctor.</p>



causes


<p>Carpal tunnel syndrome occurs as a result of compression of the median nerve. </p>
<p>The median nerve runs from your forearm through a passageway in your wrist (carpal tunnel) to your hand. It provides sensation to the palm side of your thumb and fingers, with the exception of your little finger. It also provides nerve signals to move the muscles around the base of your thumb (motor function). </p>
<p>In general, anything that crowds, irritates or compresses the median nerve in the carpal tunnel space can lead to carpal tunnel syndrome. For example, a wrist fracture can narrow the carpal tunnel and irritate the nerve, as can the swelling and inflammation resulting from rheumatoid arthritis.</p>
<p>In many cases, no single cause can be identified. It may be that a combination of risk factors contributes to the development of the condition.</p>



FEMALE-INFERTILITY
definition


<p>Infertility means that couples have been trying to get pregnant with frequent intercourse for at least a year with no success. Female infertility, male infertility or a combination of the two affects millions of couples in the United States. An estimated 10 to 15 percent of couples have trouble getting pregnant or getting to a successful delivery. </p>
<p>Infertility results from female infertility factors about one-third of the time and male infertility factors about one-third of the time. In the rest, the cause is either unknown or a combination of male and female factors. </p>
<p>The cause of female infertility can be difficult to diagnose, but many treatments are available. Treatment options depend on the underlying problem. Treatment isn't always necessary &mdash; many infertile couples will go on to conceive a child spontaneously. </p>

symptoms


<p>The main symptom of infertility is the inability of a couple to get pregnant. A menstrual cycle that's too long (35 days or more), too short (less than 21 days), irregular or absent can be a sign of lack of ovulation, which can be associated with female infertility. There may be no other outward signs or symptoms. </p>
<h3>When to see a doctor</h3>
<p>When to seek help depends, in part, on your age. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>If you're in your early 30s or younger,</strong> most doctors recommend trying to get pregnant for at least a year before having any testing or treatment. </li>
    <li><strong>If you're between 35 and 40,</strong> discuss your concerns with your doctor after six months of trying. </li>
    <li><strong>If you're older than 40,</strong> your doctor may want to begin testing or treatment right away. </li>
</ul>
<p>Your doctor also may want to begin testing or treatment right away if you or your partner has known fertility problems, or if you have a history of irregular or painful periods, pelvic inflammatory disease, repeated miscarriages, prior cancer treatment, or endometriosis. </p>



risk-factors


<p>Certain factors may put you at higher risk of infertility, including: </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Age.</strong> With increasing age, the quality and quantity of a woman's eggs begin to decline. In the mid-30s, the rate of follicle loss accelerates, resulting in fewer and poorer quality eggs, making conception more challenging and increasing the risk of miscarriage. </li>
    <li><strong>Smoking.</strong> Besides damaging your cervix and fallopian tubes, smoking increases your risk of miscarriage and ectopic pregnancy. It's also thought to age your ovaries and deplete your eggs prematurely, reducing your ability to get pregnant. Stop smoking before beginning fertility treatment. </li>
    <li><strong>Weight.</strong> If you're overweight or significantly underweight, it may hinder normal ovulation. Getting to a healthy body mass index (BMI) has been shown to increase the frequency of ovulation and likelihood of pregnancy. </li>
    <li><strong>Sexual history.</strong> Sexually transmitted infections such as chlamydia and gonorrhea can cause fallopian tube damage. Having unprotected intercourse with multiple partners increases your chances of contracting a sexually transmitted disease (STD) that may cause fertility problems later. </li>
    <li><strong>Alcohol.</strong> Heavy drinking is associated with an increased risk of ovulation disorders and endometriosis. </li>
</ul>



treatment


<p>How your infertility is treated depends on the cause, your age, how long you've been infertile and personal preferences. Because infertility is a complex disorder, treatment involves significant financial, physical, psychological and time commitments. Although some women need just one or two therapies to restore fertility, it's possible that several different types of treatment may be needed before you're able to conceive. </p>
<p>Treatments can either attempt to restore fertility &mdash; by means of medication or surgery &mdash; or assist in reproduction with sophisticated techniques. </p>
<h3>Fertility restoration: Stimulating ovulation with fertility drugs</h3>
<p>Fertility drugs, which regulate or induce ovulation, are the main treatment for women who are infertile due to ovulation disorders. In general, they work like the natural hormones &mdash; follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) &mdash; to trigger ovulation. They are also used in women who ovulate to try to stimulate a better egg or an extra egg or eggs. Fertility drugs may include: </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Clomiphene citrate.</strong> Clomiphene citrate (Clomid, Serophene)<strong> </strong>is taken by mouth and stimulates ovulation by causing the pituitary gland to release more FSH and LH, which stimulate the growth of an ovarian follicle containing an egg. </li>
    <li><strong>Gonadotropins.</strong> Instead of stimulating the pituitary gland to release more hormones, these injected treatments stimulate the ovary directly. Gonadotropin medications include<strong> </strong>human menopausal gonadotropin or hMG (Repronex, Menopur) and FSH (Gonal-F, Follistim AQ, Bravelle). All act to stimulate production of multiple eggs. Another gonadotropin, human chorionic gonadotropin (Ovidrel, Pregnyl), is used to mature the eggs and trigger their release at the time of ovulation. </li>
    <li><strong>Metformin.</strong> Metformin (Glucophage, others) is used when insulin resistance is a known or suspected cause of infertility, usually in women with a diagnosis of PCOS. Metformin helps improve insulin resistance, which can make ovulation more likely to occur. </li>
    <li><strong>Letrozole.</strong> Letrozole (Femara) belongs to a class of drugs known as aromatase inhibitors and works in a similar fashion to clomiphene. Letrozole may induce ovulation. However, the effect this medication has on early pregnancy isn't yet known, so it isn't used for ovulation induction as frequently as others. </li>
    <li><strong>Bromocriptine.</strong> Bromocriptine (Parlodel, Cycloset) may be used when ovulation problems are caused by excess production of prolactin (hyperprolactinemia) by the pituitary gland. </li>
</ul>
<h3>Risks of fertility drugs</h3>
<p>Using fertility drugs carries some risks, such as: </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Pregnancy with multiples.</strong> Oral medications carry a fairly low risk of multiples (less than 10 percent) and mostly a risk of twins, but your chances increase to about 15 to 20 percent with injectable medications. Injectable fertility medications also carry the major risk of triplets or more (higher order multiple pregnancy). Generally, the more fetuses you're carrying, the greater the risk of premature labor, low birth weight and later developmental problems. Sometimes adjusting medications can lower the risk of multiples, if too many follicles develop. </li>
    <li><strong>Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS).</strong> Use of injectable fertility drugs to induce ovulation can cause OHSS, in which your ovaries become swollen and painful. Signs and symptoms typically last a week and include mild abdominal pain, bloating, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. If you become pregnant, however, your symptoms might last several weeks. Rarely, it's possible to develop a more severe form of OHSS that can also cause rapid weight gain, enlarged painful ovaries, fluid in the abdomen and shortness of breath. </li>
    <li><strong>Long-term risks of ovarian tumors.</strong> Most studies of women using fertility drugs suggest that there are few if any long-term risks. However, some studies suggest that women taking fertility drugs for 12 or more months without a successful pregnancy may have an associated increased risk of borderline ovarian tumors later in life. Women who never have pregnancies have an increased risk of ovarian tumors, so it may be related to the underlying problem rather than the treatment. However, since success rates are typically higher in the first few cycles, re-evaluating medication use every few months and concentrating on the treatments that have the most success appear to be appropriate. </li>
</ul>
<h3>Fertility restoration: Surgery</h3>
<p>Several surgical procedures can correct problems or otherwise improve female fertility. However, surgical treatments for fertility are rare these days now that other fertility treatments have high success. They include: </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Laparoscopic or hysteroscopic surgery.</strong> These surgeries can remove or correct abnormalities that decrease pregnancy rates. This can include correcting an abnormal uterine shape, removing endometrial polyps and some types of fibroids that misshape the uterine cavity or pelvic or uterine adhesions. This can improve your chances of achieving pregnancy. </li>
    <li><strong>Tubal ligation reversal surgery (microscopic).</strong> After a woman has had her tubes tied for permanent contraception (tubal ligation), surgery may be done to reconnect them and restore fertility. Your doctor can determine whether you're a good candidate for this or whether in vitro fertilization (IVF) might be a better choice for you. </li>
    <li><strong>Tubal surgeries.</strong> If your fallopian tubes are blocked or filled with fluid (hydrosalpinx), laparoscopic surgery may be performed to remove adhesions, dilate a tube or create a new tubal opening. However, this is rarely done, as pregnancy rates are usually better with IVF. For hydrosalpinx, removal of your tubes (salpingectomy) or blocking the tubes close to the uterus can improve your chances of pregnancy with IVF. </li>
</ul>
<h3>Reproductive assistance</h3>
<p>The most commonly used methods of reproductive assistance include: </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Intrauterine insemination (IUI).</strong> During IUI, millions of healthy sperm are placed inside the uterus close to the time of ovulation. </li>
    <li><strong>Assisted reproductive technology.</strong> These methods involve retrieving mature eggs from a woman, fertilizing them with a man's sperm in a dish in a lab, then transferring the embryos into the uterus after fertilization. IVF is the most effective assisted reproductive technology. An IVF cycle takes several weeks and requires frequent blood tests and daily hormone injections. </li>
</ul>



prevention


<p>If you're a woman thinking about getting pregnant soon or in the future, you may improve your chances of having normal fertility if you: </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Maintain a normal weight.</strong> Overweight and underweight women are at increased risk of ovulation disorders. If you need to lose weight, exercise moderately. Strenuous, intense exercise of more than seven hours a week has been associated with decreased ovulation. </li>
    <li><strong>Quit smoking.</strong> Tobacco has multiple negative effects on fertility, not to mention your general health and the health of a fetus. If you smoke and are considering pregnancy, quit now. </li>
    <li><strong>Avoid alcohol.</strong> Heavy alcohol use may lead to decreased fertility. And any alcohol use can affect the health of a developing fetus. If you're planning to become pregnant, avoid alcohol, and don't drink alcohol while you're pregnant. </li>
    <li><strong>Reduce stress.</strong> Some studies have shown that couples experiencing psychological stress had poorer results with infertility treatment. If you can, find a way to reduce stress in your life before trying to become pregnant. </li>
    <li><strong>Limit caffeine.</strong> Some physicians suggest limiting caffeine intake to less than 200 to 300 milligrams a day. </li>
</ul>



NEUROENDOCRINE-TUMORS
definition


<p>Neuroendocrine tumors are abnormal growths that begin in specialized cells called neuroendocrine cells. Neuroendocrine cells have traits similar to nerve cells and to hormone-producing cells.</p>
<p>Neuroendocrine tumors are rare and can occur anywhere in the body. Most neuroendocrine tumors occur in the lungs, appendix, small intestine, rectum and pancreas.</p>
<p>Neuroendocrine tumors can be noncancerous (benign) or cancerous (malignant).</p>
<p>Examples of neuroendocrine tumors include:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="/diseases-conditions/carcinoid-tumors/basics/definition/con-20030114">Carcinoid tumors</a> of the lung, intestinal tract or thymus</li>
    <li>Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor, also known as <a href="/diseases-conditions/islet-cell-cancer/basics/definition/con-20035673">islet cell cancer</a></li>
    <li><a href="/diseases-conditions/thyroid-cancer/basics/definition/con-20043551">Medullary thyroid carcinoma</a></li>
    <li><a href="/diseases-conditions/merkel-cell-carcinoma/basics/definition/con-20026875">Merkel cell carcinoma</a>, also known as neuroendocrine carcinoma of the skin</li>
    <li><a href="/diseases-conditions/pheochromocytoma/basics/definition/con-20030435">Pheochromocytoma</a> of the adrenal gland</li>
    <li><a href="/diseases-conditions/adrenal-cancer/basics/definition/con-20028298">Adrenal cancer</a></li>
    <li>Small cell carcinoma, most commonly of the lung</li>
    <li>Large cell carcinoid tumor, most commonly of the lung</li>
</ul>
<p>Diagnosis and treatment of neuroendocrine tumors depends on the type of tumor, its location, whether it produces excess hormones, how aggressive it is and whether it has spread to other parts of the body.</p>



HANGOVERS
definition


<p>A hangover is a group of unpleasant signs and symptoms that can develop after drinking too much alcohol. As if feeling awful weren't bad enough, hangover is also associated with poor performance and conflict at work. </p>
<p>As a general rule, the more alcohol you drink, the more likely you are to have a hangover the next day. But there's no magic formula to tell you how much you can safely drink and still avoid a hangover. </p>
<p>However unpleasant, most hangovers go away on their own, though they can last up to 24 hours. If you choose to drink alcohol, doing so responsibly can help you avoid future hangovers. </p>

HIGH-BLOOD-PRESSURE
definition


<p>High blood pressure is a common condition in which the force of the blood against your artery walls is high enough that it may eventually cause health problems, such as heart disease.</p>
<p>Blood pressure is determined by the amount of blood your heart pumps and the amount of resistance to blood flow in your arteries. The more blood your heart pumps and the narrower your arteries, the higher your blood pressure.</p>
<p>You can have high blood pressure (hypertension) for years without any symptoms. Even without symptoms, damage to blood vessels and your heart continues and can be detected. Uncontrolled high blood pressure increases your risk of serious health problems, including heart attack and stroke.</p>
<p>High blood pressure generally develops over many years, and it affects nearly everyone eventually. Fortunately, high blood pressure can be easily detected. And once you know you have high blood pressure, you can work with your doctor to control it.</p>



HIV-AIDS
definition


<p>AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) is a chronic, potentially life-threatening condition caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). By damaging your immune system, HIV interferes with your body's ability to fight the organisms that cause disease.</p>
<p>HIV is a sexually transmitted infection. It can also be spread by contact with infected blood or from mother to child during pregnancy, childbirth or breast-feeding. It can take years before HIV weakens your immune system to the point that you have AIDS.</p>
<p>There's no cure for HIV/AIDS, but there are medications that can dramatically slow disease progression. These drugs have reduced AIDS deaths in many developed nations. But HIV continues to decimate populations in Africa, Haiti and parts of Asia.</p>



OCULAR-ROSACEA
definition


<p>Ocular rosacea (roe-ZAY-she-uh) is inflammation of the eye that occurs as a result of rosacea, a chronic, inflammatory condition that affects the skin on your face, nose and forehead. Many people with skin rosacea develop ocular rosacea, usually in combination with skin symptoms, but occasionally ocular rosacea occurs by itself. </p>
<p>Ocular rosacea primarily affects adults between the ages of 30 and 60. Ocular rosacea is more common in people with fair skin. </p>
<p>If you have skin rosacea, you may not realize that your ocular rosacea symptoms, such as dry eyes, are connected to the condition. There's no cure for ocular rosacea, and left untreated, it tends to get worse. There are medications to help you manage the condition. </p>

FRONTOTEMPORAL-DEMENTIA
definition


<p>Frontotemporal dementia (frontotemporal lobar degeneration) is an umbrella term for a diverse group of uncommon disorders that primarily affect the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain &mdash; the areas generally associated with personality, behavior and language.</p>
<p>In frontotemporal dementia, portions of these lobes atrophy or shrink. Signs and symptoms vary, depending upon the portion of the brain affected. Some people with frontotemporal dementia undergo dramatic changes in their personality and become socially inappropriate, impulsive or emotionally indifferent, while others lose the ability to use language.</p>
<p>Frontotemporal dementia is often misdiagnosed as a psychiatric problem or as Alzheimer's disease. But frontotemporal dementia tends to occur at a younger age than does Alzheimer's disease, generally between the ages of 40 and 75.</p>



INCOMPETENT-CERVIX
definition


<p>An incompetent cervix, also called an insufficient cervix, is a condition that occurs when weak cervical tissue causes or contributes to premature birth or the loss of an otherwise healthy pregnancy. </p>
<p>Before pregnancy, your cervix &mdash; the lower part of the uterus that connects to the vagina &mdash; is normally closed and rigid. As pregnancy progresses and you prepare to give birth, the cervix gradually softens, decreases in length (effaces) and opens (dilates). If you have an incompetent cervix, your cervix might begin to open too soon &mdash; causing you to give birth too early. </p>
<p>An incompetent cervix can be difficult to diagnose and, as a result, treat. If your cervix begins to open early, your health care provider might recommend preventive medication during pregnancy, frequent ultrasounds or a procedure that closes the cervix with strong sutures (cervical cerclage). </p>



TRICHOTILLOMANIA
definition


<p>Trichotillomania (trik-o-til-o-MAY-nee-uh) is a disorder that involves recurrent, irresistible urges to pull out hair from your scalp, eyebrows or other areas of your body, despite trying to stop.</p>
<p>Hair pulling from the scalp often leaves patchy bald spots, which causes significant distress and can interfere with social or work functioning. People with trichotillomania may go to great lengths to disguise the loss of hair.</p>
<p>For some people, trichotillomania may be mild and generally manageable. For others, the compulsive urge to pull hair is overwhelming. Some treatment options have helped many people reduce their hair pulling or stop entirely.</p>



DIABETIC-NEPHROPATHY
definition


<p>Diabetic kidney disease, or diabetic nephropathy, is a complication of type 1 or type 2 diabetes caused by damage to the kidneys' delicate filtering system.</p>
<p>Your kidneys contain millions of tiny blood vessel clusters (glomeruli) that filter waste from your blood. Severe damage to these blood vessels can lead to diabetic nephropathy, which may lead to kidney failure or irreversible end-stage kidney disease, requiring dialysis or a kidney transplant.</p>
<p>If you have diabetic nephropathy, it's very important for you to have your kidney function tested and monitored to prevent it from worsening and reduce your risk of heart disease.</p>
<p>If you have additional conditions &mdash; such as high cholesterol, high blood pressure or anemia &mdash; or you're obese or you smoke, your risk of diabetic nephropathy increases even more.</p>



SUBCONJUNCTIVAL-HEMORRHAGE
definition


<p>A subconjunctival hemorrhage (sub-kun-JUNK-tih-vul HEM-uh-ruj) occurs when a tiny blood vessel breaks just underneath the clear surface of your eye (conjunctiva). </p>
<p>You may not realize you have a subconjunctival hemorrhage until you look in the mirror and find the white part of your eye is bright red.</p>
<p>The conjunctiva can't absorb the blood very quickly, so the blood is trapped under this transparent surface. A subconjunctival hemorrhage may worry you, but it's usually a harmless condition that disappears within one or two weeks.</p>
<p>Subconjunctival hemorrhage often occurs without any obvious harm to your eye, or it may be the result of a strong sneeze or cough that caused a blood vessel to break. You don't need any specific treatment for a subconjunctival hemorrhage.</p>



HEART-MURMURS
definition


<p>Heart murmurs are abnormal sounds during your heartbeat cycle &mdash; such as whooshing or swishing &mdash; made by turbulent blood in or near your heart. These sounds can be heard with a stethoscope. A normal heartbeat makes two sounds like "lubb-dupp" (sometimes described as "lub-DUP"), which are the sounds of your heart valves closing. </p>
<p>Heart murmurs can be present at birth (congenital) or develop later in life. A heart murmur isn't a disease &mdash; but murmurs may indicate an underlying heart problem. </p>
<p>Most heart murmurs are harmless (innocent) and don't need treatment. Some heart murmurs may require follow-up tests to be sure the murmur isn't caused by a serious underlying heart condition. Treatment, if needed, is directed at the cause of your heart murmurs. </p>

DIABETIC-NEUROPATHY
definition


<p>Diabetic neuropathy is a type of nerve damage that can occur if you have diabetes. High blood sugar can injure nerve fibers throughout your body, but diabetic neuropathy most often damages nerves in your legs and feet. </p>
<p>Depending on the affected nerves, symptoms of diabetic neuropathy can range from pain and numbness in your extremities to problems with your digestive system, urinary tract, blood vessels and heart. For some people, these symptoms are mild; for others, diabetic neuropathy can be painful, disabling and even fatal. </p>
<p>Diabetic neuropathy is a common serious complication of diabetes. Yet you can often prevent diabetic neuropathy or slow its progress with tight blood sugar control and a healthy lifestyle. </p>

<p>Autoimmune hepatitis is inflammation in your liver that occurs when your body's immune system attacks your liver. Although the cause of autoimmune hepatitis isn't entirely clear, some diseases, toxins and drugs may trigger autoimmune hepatitis in susceptible people, especially women. </p>
<p>Untreated autoimmune hepatitis can lead to scarring of the liver (cirrhosis) and eventually to liver failure. When diagnosed and treated early, however, autoimmune hepatitis often can be controlled with drugs that suppress the immune system. </p>

<p>Osteoporosis causes bones to become weak and brittle &mdash; so brittle that a fall or even mild stresses like bending over or coughing can cause a fracture. Osteoporosis-related fractures most commonly occur in the hip, wrist or spine. </p>
<p>Bone is living tissue, which is constantly being absorbed and replaced. Osteoporosis occurs when the creation of new bone doesn't keep up with the removal of old bone. </p>
<p>Osteoporosis affects men and women of all races. But white and Asian women &mdash; especially those who are past menopause &mdash; are at highest risk. Medications, healthy diet and weight-bearing exercise can help prevent bone loss or strengthen already weak bones. </p>

HYPOTHYROIDISM
definition


<p>Hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid) is a condition in which your thyroid gland doesn't produce enough of certain important hormones. </p>
<p>Women, especially those older than age 60, are more likely to have hypothyroidism. Hypothyroidism upsets the normal balance of chemical reactions in your body. It seldom causes symptoms in the early stages, but, over time, untreated hypothyroidism can cause a number of health problems, such as obesity, joint pain, infertility and heart disease. </p>
<p>The good news is that accurate thyroid function tests are available to diagnose hypothyroidism, and treatment of hypothyroidism with synthetic thyroid hormone is usually simple, safe and effective once you and your doctor find the right dose for you. </p>

STAPH-INFECTIONS
definition


<p>Staph infections are caused by staphylococcus bacteria, types of germs commonly found on the skin or in the nose of even healthy individuals. Most of the time, these bacteria cause no problems or result in relatively minor skin infections.</p>
<p>But staph infections can turn deadly if the bacteria invade deeper into your body, entering your bloodstream, joints, bones, lungs or heart. A growing number of otherwise healthy people are developing life-threatening staph infections.</p>
<p>Treatment usually involves antibiotics and drainage of the infected area. However, some staph infections no longer respond to common antibiotics.</p>



PERSONALITY-DISORDERS
definition


<p>A personality disorder is a type of mental disorder in which you have a rigid and unhealthy pattern of thinking, functioning and behaving. A person with a personality disorder has trouble perceiving and relating to situations and to people. This causes significant problems and limitations in relationships, social encounters, work and school.</p>
<p>In some cases, you may not realize that you have a personality disorder because your way of thinking and behaving seems natural to you. And you may blame others for the challenges you face.</p>
<p>Personality disorders usually begin in the teenage years or early adulthood. There are many types of personality disorders. Some types may become less obvious throughout middle age.</p>

BLOOD-IN-URINE
definition


<p>Seeing blood in your urine can cause anxiety. While in many instances there are benign causes, blood in urine (hematuria) can also indicate a serious disorder.</p>
<p>Blood that you can see is called gross hematuria. Urinary blood that's visible only under a microscope is known as microscopic hematuria and is found when your doctor tests your urine. Either way, it's important to determine the reason for the bleeding. Treatment depends on the underlying cause.</p>

<p>Rhabdomyosarcoma is a rare cancer that begins in your muscles. Rhabdomyosarcoma most commonly forms in the head and neck, bladder, vagina, prostate, testes, arms, or legs.</p>
<p>Rhabdomyosarcoma is a type of soft tissue sarcoma.</p>
<p>Rhabdomyosarcoma can occur at any age, but it most often affects children and young adults. Treatment for rhabdomyosarcoma often involves surgery, chemotherapy and radiation therapy.</p>

RUMINATION-SYNDROME
definition


<p>Rumination syndrome is a condition in which people repeatedly and unintentionally spit up (regurgitate) undigested food from the stomach, rechew it, and then either reswallow the food or spit it out. Rumination is a reflex, not a conscious decision. Rumination syndrome may go undiagnosed because it is often confused with other conditions.</p>
<h3>About</h3>
<p>People with rumination syndrome repeatedly regurgitate small amounts of food from the stomach without trying to do so. The food is then partially or completely rechewed and reswallowed or spit out. The food hasn't been digested, so people with rumination syndrome often report that the food tastes normal, not acidic like vomit.</p>
<p>Rumination syndrome is frequently confused with bulimia nervosa, <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.org/gerd/">gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)</a> and <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.org/gastroparesis/">gastroparesis</a>. The condition has long been known to occur in infants and people with developmental disabilities. But it can also occur in other children, adolescents and adults.</p>
<p>The precise cause is unknown. Rumination may be an unconscious, learned behavior that involves the belch reflex. Untreated, rumination syndrome can damage the tube between your mouth and stomach (esophagus) and cause unhealthy weight loss.</p>

TOE-WALKING
definition


<p>Walking on the toes or the ball of the foot, also known as toe walking, is fairly common in children who are just beginning to walk. Most children outgrow toe walking. Kids who continue toe walking beyond the toddler years often do so out of habit. As long as your child is growing and developing normally, toe walking on its own is unlikely to be a cause of concern. </p>
<p>Toe walking is sometimes the result of cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy or another generalized disease of nerve and muscle. Children with autism also may walk on their toes or the balls of their feet, but many do not. </p>

MOLAR-PREGNANCY
definition


<p>A molar pregnancy &mdash; also known as hydatidiform mole &mdash; is a noncancerous (benign) tumor that develops in the uterus. A molar pregnancy occurs when there is an extra set of paternal chromosomes in a fertilized egg. This error at the time of conception transforms what would normally become the placenta into a growing mass of cysts. </p>
<p>In a complete molar pregnancy, there's no embryo or normal placental tissue. In a partial molar pregnancy, there's an abnormal embryo and possibly some normal placental tissue. The embryo begins to develop but is malformed and can't survive. </p>
<p>A molar pregnancy can have serious complications &mdash; including a rare form of cancer &mdash; and requires early treatment. </p>



ECTOPIC-PREGNANCY
definition


<p>Pregnancy begins with a fertilized egg. Normally, the fertilized egg attaches itself to the lining of the uterus. With an ectopic pregnancy, the fertilized egg implants somewhere outside the uterus. </p>
<p>An ectopic pregnancy typically occurs in one of the tubes that carry eggs from the ovaries to the uterus (fallopian tubes). This type of ectopic pregnancy is known as a tubal pregnancy. In some cases, however, an ectopic pregnancy occurs in the abdominal cavity, ovary or neck of the uterus (cervix). </p>
<p>An ectopic pregnancy can't proceed normally. The fertilized egg can't survive, and the growing tissue might destroy various maternal structures. Left untreated, life-threatening blood loss is possible. Early treatment of an ectopic pregnancy can help preserve the chance for future healthy pregnancies. </p>



DUST-MITES
definition


<p>Dust mite allergy is an allergic reaction to tiny bugs that commonly live in house dust. Signs of dust mite allergy include sneezing and runny nose. Many people with dust mite allergy also experience signs of asthma, such as wheezing and difficulty breathing. </p>
<p>Dust mites, close relatives of ticks and spiders, are too small to see without a microscope. Dust mites eat skin cells shed by people, and they thrive in warm, humid environments. In most homes, bedding, upholstered furniture and carpeting provide an ideal environment for dust mites. </p>
<p>Steps to reduce the number of dust mites in your home can often control dust mite allergy. Medications or other treatments may be necessary to relieve symptoms and manage asthma. </p>



ACANTHOSIS-NIGRICANS
definition


<p>Acanthosis nigricans (ak-an-THOE-sis NIE-grih-kuns) is a skin condition characterized by areas of dark, velvety discoloration in body folds and creases. The affected skin can become thickened and may smell bad. Most often, acanthosis nigricans affects your armpits, groin and neck. </p>
<p>These skin changes typically occur in people who are obese or have diabetes. Children who develop the condition are at higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes. More rarely, acanthosis nigricans can be a warning sign of a cancerous tumor in an internal organ, such as the stomach or liver. </p>
<p>Acanthosis nigricans is most common in Native Americans, blacks and Hispanics. There's no specific treatment for acanthosis nigricans. Treatment of underlying conditions may restore some of the normal color and texture to affected areas of skin. </p>



SEPARATION-ANXIETY
definition


<p>You used to leave your baby with loved ones or other trusted child care providers with a kiss on the cheek and a quick wave goodbye. Separation anxiety seemed to be a problem only for other kids. Now, however, your goodbyes trigger tears. What's going on? </p>
<p>Between ages 8 and 12 months, children often experience a period of separation anxiety. Frustrating as it may be, separation anxiety is actually an emotional milestone. Your child is beginning to understand that there's only one of you &mdash; and you still exist even when you aren't in sight. This can trigger tears when you leave the room or clingy behavior when you attempt to say goodbye. </p>
<p>Separation anxiety usually fades by age 24 months. In the meantime, say goodbye gently and reassure your child that you'll return soon. Separation anxiety rarely requires medical treatment. </p>



INTRACRANIAL-VENOUS-MALFORMATIONS
definition


<p>Intracranial venous malformations are abnormally enlarged veins in your brain. Venous malformations are a type of blood vessel abnormality in your brain or spinal cord (<a href="/diseases-conditions/central-nervous-system-vascular-malformations/basics/definition/con-20034720">central nervous system vascular malformations</a>).</p>



ALCOHOL-INTOLERANCE
definition


<p>Alcohol intolerance can cause immediate, unpleasant reactions after you consume alcohol. The most common signs and symptoms of alcohol intolerance are nasal congestion and skin flushing. This condition is sometimes inaccurately referred to as an alcohol allergy. Alcohol intolerance is caused by a genetic condition in which the body is unable to break down alcohol. The only way to prevent alcohol intolerance is to avoid alcohol altogether. </p>
<p>In some cases, what may seem to be alcohol intolerance is caused by a reaction to something else in an alcoholic beverage &mdash; such as chemicals, grains or preservatives. In other cases, reactions are caused by combining alcohol with certain medications. In rare instances, reactions to alcohol can be a sign of a serious underlying health problem that requires diagnosis and treatment. </p>



MYELODYSPLASTIC-SYNDROMES
definition


<p>Myelodysplastic syndromes are a group of disorders caused by poorly formed or dysfunctional blood cells. Myelodysplastic syndromes occur when something goes wrong in your bone marrow &mdash; the spongy material inside your bones where blood cells are made.</p>
<p>There is no cure for myelodysplastic syndromes. Treatment for myelodysplastic syndromes usually focuses on reducing or preventing complications of the disease and its treatments. In certain cases, myelodysplastic syndromes are treated with a bone marrow transplant, which may help prolong life.</p>



NICKEL-ALLERGY
definition


<p>Nickel allergy is one of the most common causes of allergic contact dermatitis &mdash; an itchy rash that appears when your skin touches a usually harmless substance. </p>
<p>Nickel allergy is commonly associated with earrings and other jewelry, particularly jewelry associated with body piercings. But nickel can be found in many everyday items &mdash; from coins to zippers, from cellphones to eyeglass frames. </p>
<p>Nickel allergy can affect people of all ages. A nickel allergy usually develops after repeated or prolonged exposure to items containing nickel. Treatments can reduce the symptoms of nickel allergy. Once you develop nickel allergy, however, you will always be sensitive to the metal and need to avoid contact. </p>



VOCAL-CORD-PARALYSIS
definition


<p>Vocal cord paralysis occurs when the nerve impulses to your voice box (larynx) are interrupted. This results in paralysis of the muscle of the vocal cords. Vocal cord paralysis can affect your ability to speak and even breathe. That's because your vocal cords, sometimes called vocal folds, do more than just produce sound. They also protect your airway by preventing food, drink and even your saliva from entering your windpipe (trachea) and causing you to choke. </p>
<p>There are a number of causes of vocal cord paralysis including damage to nerves during surgery and certain cancers. Vocal cord paralysis can also be caused by a viral infection or a neurological disorder. </p>
<p>Treatment for vocal cord paralysis usually includes voice therapy; however, surgery is also sometimes necessary.</p>



DRY-EYES
definition


<p>Dry eyes occur when your tears aren't able to provide adequate moisture for your eyes. Tears can be inadequate for many reasons. For example, dry eyes may occur if you don't produce enough tears or if you produce poor-quality tears. </p>
<p>Dry eyes feel uncomfortable. If you have dry eyes, your eyes may sting or burn. You may experience dry eyes in certain situations, such as on an airplane, in an air-conditioned room, while riding a bike, or after looking at a computer screen for a few hours. </p>
<p>Treatments for dry eyes may make you more comfortable. These treatments can include lifestyle changes and eyedrops. For more-serious cases of dry eyes, surgery may be an option. </p>



KIDNEY-FAILURE
definition


<p>Acute kidney failure occurs when your kidneys suddenly become unable to filter waste products from your blood. When your kidneys lose their filtering ability, dangerous levels of wastes may accumulate and your blood's chemical makeup may get out of balance. </p>
<p>Acute kidney failure &mdash; also called acute renal failure or acute kidney injury &mdash; develops rapidly over a few hours or a few days. Acute kidney failure is most common in people who are already hospitalized, particularly in critically ill people who need intensive care. </p>
<p>Acute kidney failure can be fatal and requires intensive treatment. However, acute kidney failure may be reversible. If you're otherwise in good health, you may recover normal kidney function. </p>

CHONDROMALACIA-PATELLA
definition


<p>The cartilage under your kneecap is a natural shock absorber. Overuse, injury or other factors may lead to a condition known as chondromalacia patella (kon-droh-muh-LAY-shuh puh-TEL-uh) &mdash; a general term indicating damage to the cartilage under your kneecap. A more accurate term for chondromalacia patella is patellofemoral (puh-tel-o-FEM-uh-rul) pain syndrome. </p>
<p>The most common symptom is knee pain that increases when you walk up or down stairs. Simple treatments &mdash; such as rest and ice &mdash; often help, but sometimes physical therapy or even surgery is needed to ease patellofemoral pain. </p>



VENTRICULAR-SEPTAL-DEFECT
definition


<p>A ventricular septal defect (VSD), also called a hole in the heart, is a common heart defect that's present at birth (congenital). The defect involves an opening (hole) in the heart forming between the heart's lower chambers, allowing oxygen-rich and oxygen-poor blood to mix. </p>
<p>A baby with a small ventricular septal defect may have no problems. A baby with a larger ventricular septal defect or associated heart defects may have a telltale bluish tint to the skin (cyanosis) &mdash; due to oxygen-poor blood &mdash; often most visible in the lips and fingernails. Ventricular septal defects are sometimes not diagnosed until adulthood. </p>
<p>Fortunately, ventricular septal defect is treatable. Many small ventricular septal defects often close on their own or don't cause problems. Larger ventricular septal defects need surgical repair early in life to prevent complications. Some smaller ventricular septal defects are closed to prevent complications related to their location, such as damage to heart valves. Many people with small ventricular septal defects have normal, productive lives with few related problems. </p>



CORNS-AND-CALLUSES
definition


<p>Corns and calluses are thick, hardened layers of skin that develop when your skin tries to protect itself against friction and pressure. They most often develop on the feet and toes or hands and fingers. Corns and calluses can be unsightly.</p>
<p>If you're healthy, you need treatment for corns and calluses only if they cause discomfort. For most people, simply eliminating the source of friction or pressure makes corns and calluses disappear.</p>
<p>If you have diabetes or another condition that causes poor blood flow to your feet, you're at greater risk of complications from corns and calluses. Seek your doctor's advice on proper care for corns and calluses if you have such a condition.</p>



POSTPARTUM-DEPRESSION
definition


<p>The birth of a baby can trigger a jumble of powerful emotions, from excitement and joy to fear and anxiety. But it can also result in something you might not expect &mdash; depression. </p>
<p>Many new moms experience the "baby blues" after childbirth, which commonly include mood swings and crying spells that fade quickly. But some new moms experience a more severe, long-lasting form of depression known as postpartum depression. Rarely, an extreme form of postpartum depression known as postpartum psychosis develops after childbirth. </p>
<p>Postpartum depression isn't a character flaw or a weakness. Sometimes it's simply a complication of giving birth. If you have postpartum depression, prompt treatment can help you manage your symptoms &mdash; and enjoy your baby. </p>



PROCTITIS
definition


<p>Proctitis is an inflammation of the lining of the rectum. The rectum is a muscular tube that's connected to the end of your colon. Stool passes through the rectum on its way out of the body. </p>
<p>Proctitis can cause rectal pain and the continuous sensation that you need to have a bowel movement. Proctitis symptoms can be short-lived, or they can become chronic. </p>
<p>Proctitis is common in people who have inflammatory bowel diseases. Sexually transmitted infections are another frequent cause. Proctitis also can be a side effect of radiation therapy for certain cancers. </p>



CHEMO-BRAIN
definition


<p>Chemo brain is a common term used by cancer survivors to describe thinking and memory problems that can occur after cancer treatment. Chemo brain can also be called chemo fog, chemotherapy-related cognitive impairment or cognitive dysfunction. </p>
<p>Though chemo brain is a widely used term, it's misleading. It's unlikely that chemotherapy is the sole cause of concentration and memory problems in cancer survivors. </p>
<p>Despite the many questions, it's clear that the memory problems commonly called chemo brain can be a frustrating and debilitating side effect of cancer and its treatment. More study is needed to understand this condition. </p>



ANEMIA
definition


<p>Anemia is a condition in which you don't have enough healthy red blood cells to carry adequate oxygen to your tissues. Having anemia may make you feel tired and weak.</p>
<p>There are many forms of anemia, each with its own cause. Loss of blood is the most common cause of anemia. Anemia can be temporary or long term, and it can range from mild to severe.</p>
<p>Treatments for anemia range from taking supplements to undergoing medical procedures. You may be able to prevent some types of anemia by eating a healthy, varied diet.</p>
<p>See your doctor if you suspect you have anemia because anemia can be a sign of serious illnesses.</p>



MEMBRANOUS-NEPHROPATHY
definition


<p>Membranous nephropathy is a disease in which the small blood vessels in the kidney (glomeruli), which filter wastes from the blood, become inflamed and thickened. As a result, proteins leak from the damaged blood vessels into the urine (proteinuria). For many, the loss of these proteins eventually causes some signs and symptoms known as nephrotic syndrome.</p>
<p>In mild cases, the disease often gets better on its own, without any treatment (remission). As the level of protein leakage increases, so does the risk of long-lasting damage. In many people (as many as 40 percent), the disease ultimately leads to kidney failure. Although there's no cure, treatments are available to slow the progress of the disease.</p>



PERIPHERAL-NEUROPATHY
definition


<p>Peripheral neuropathy, a result of nerve damage, often causes weakness, numbness and pain, usually in your hands and feet, but it may also occur in other areas of your body. </p>
<p>People generally describe the pain of peripheral neuropathy as tingling or burning, while they may compare the loss of sensation to the feeling of wearing a thin stocking or glove. </p>
<p>Peripheral neuropathy can result from problems such as traumatic injuries, infections, metabolic problems and exposure to toxins. One of the most common causes is diabetes. </p>
<p>In many cases, peripheral neuropathy symptoms improve with time, especially if the condition is caused by an underlying condition that can be treated. A number of medications are used to reduce the painful symptoms of peripheral neuropathy. </p>



OCCUPATIONAL-ASTHMA
definition


<p>Occupational asthma is asthma that's caused or worsened by breathing in chemical fumes, gases, dust or other substances on the job. Like other types of asthma, occupational asthma can cause chest tightness, wheezing and shortness of breath.</p>

<p>When treated early, occupational asthma may be reversible. Long-term exposure to allergy-causing substances can cause worsening symptoms and lifelong asthma.</p>

<p>Treatment for occupational asthma is similar to treatment for other types of asthma, and it generally includes taking medications to reduce symptoms. But the only sure way to eliminate your symptoms and prevent lung damage due to occupational asthma is to avoid whatever's triggering it.</p>

<p>Headaches in children are common and usually aren't serious. Like adults, children can develop different types of headaches, including migraine or stress-related (tension) headaches. Children can also have chronic daily headaches. </p>
<p>In some cases, headaches in children are caused by an infection, high levels of stress or anxiety, or minor head trauma. It's important to pay attention to your child's headache symptoms and consult a doctor if the headache worsens or occurs frequently. Headaches in children usually can be treated with over-the-counter pain medications and other lifestyle measures. </p>



CHRONIC-PELVIC-PAIN
definition


<p>Pelvic pain in women refers to pain in the lowest part of your abdomen and pelvis. If asked to locate your pain, you might sweep your hand over that entire area rather than point to a single spot. Chronic pelvic pain is pain in your pelvic region &mdash; the area below your bellybutton and between your hips &mdash; that lasts six months or longer. </p>
<p>Chronic pelvic pain can be a symptom of another disease, or it can be a condition in its own right. The cause of chronic pelvic pain is often hard to find. If the source of your chronic pelvic pain can be found, treatment focuses on that cause. </p>
<p>Some women never receive a specific diagnosis that explains their pain. But that doesn't mean your pain isn't real and treatable. If no cause can be found, treatment focuses on managing the pain. </p>

CMV
definition


<p>Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a common virus that can infect almost anyone. Most people don't know they have CMV because it rarely causes symptoms. However, if you're pregnant or have a weakened immune system, CMV is cause for concern.</p>
<p>Once infected with CMV, your body retains the virus for life. However, CMV usually remains dormant if you're healthy.</p>
<p>CMV spreads from person to person through body fluids, such as blood, saliva, urine, semen and breast milk. CMV spread through breast milk usually doesn't make the baby sick. However, if you are pregnant and develop an active infection, you can pass the virus to your baby.</p>
<p>There's no cure for CMV, but drugs can help treat newborns and people with weak immune systems.</p>

People with antisocial personality disorder typically have no regard for right and wrong and often disregard the rights, wishes and feelings of others. </p>
<p>Those with antisocial personality disorder tend to antagonize, manipulate or treat others either harshly or with callous indifference. They may often violate the law, landing in frequent trouble, yet they show no guilt or remorse. They may lie, behave violently or impulsively, and have problems with drug and alcohol use. These characteristics typically make people with antisocial personality disorder unable to fulfill responsibilities related to family, work or school. </p>



TYPE-1-DIABETES-IN-CHILDREN
definition


<p>Type 1 diabetes in children is a condition in which your child's pancreas no longer produces the insulin your child needs to survive, and you'll need to replace the missing insulin. Type 1 diabetes in children used to be known as juvenile diabetes or insulin-dependent diabetes.</p>
<p>The diagnosis of type 1 diabetes in children can be overwhelming at first. Suddenly you and your child &mdash; depending on his or her age &mdash; must learn how to give injections, count carbohydrates and monitor blood sugar.</p>
<p>Although type 1 diabetes in children requires consistent care, advances in blood sugar monitoring and insulin delivery have improved the daily management of type 1 diabetes in children.</p>

<p>It's important to identify strep throat for a number of reasons. If untreated, strep throat can sometimes cause complications such as kidney inflammation and rheumatic fever. Rheumatic fever can lead to painful and inflamed joints, a rash and even damage to heart valves. </p>
<p>Strep throat is most common between the ages of 5 and 15, but it affects people of all ages. If you or your child has signs or symptoms of strep throat, see your doctor for prompt treatment. </p>



ANAL-FISTULA
definition


<p>Anal fistula is the medical term for an infected tunnel that develops between the skin and the muscular opening at the end of the digestive tract (anus). Most anal fistulas are the result of an infection in an anal gland that spreads to the skin. Surgery is usually needed to treat anal fistula.</p>



GLIOMA
definition


<p>Glioma is a type of tumor that occurs in the brain and spinal cord. Gliomas form from the cells (glial cells) that surround and support nerve cells.</p>
<p>Types of glioma include:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Astrocytomas,</strong> including astrocytoma, anaplastic astrocytoma and glioblastoma</li>
    <li><strong>Ependymomas,</strong> including anaplastic ependymoma, myxopapillary ependymoma and subependymoma</li>
    <li><strong>Oligoastrocytomas,</strong> including oligodendroglioma, anaplastic oligodendroglioma and anaplastic oligoastrocytoma</li>
    <li><strong>Mixed tumor types,</strong> which involve more than one type of cell</li>
</ul>
<p>What type of glioma you have helps determine your treatment and your prognosis. In general, glioma treatment options include surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, targeted therapy and clinical trials.</p>



HOARDING-DISORDER
definition


<p>Hoarding disorder is a persistent difficulty discarding or parting with possessions because of a perceived need to save them. A person with hoarding disorder experiences distress at the thought of getting rid of the items. Excessive accumulation of items, regardless of actual value, occurs. </p>
<p>Hoarding often creates such cramped living conditions that homes may be filled to capacity, with only narrow pathways winding through stacks of clutter. Some people also collect animals, keeping dozens or hundreds of pets in unsanitary conditions because they can't care for them properly.</p>
<p>Hoarding ranges from mild to severe. In some cases, hoarding may not have much impact on your life, while in other cases it seriously affects your functioning on a daily basis.</p>
<p>People with hoarding disorder often don't see it as a problem, making treatment challenging. But intensive treatment can help people with hoarding disorder understand their compulsions and live safer, more enjoyable lives.</p>



PREDIABETES
definition


<p>Prediabetes means that your blood sugar level is higher than normal, but it's not yet high enough to be classified as type 2 diabetes. Still, without intervention, prediabetes is likely to become type 2 diabetes in 10 years or less. And, if you have prediabetes, the long-term damage of diabetes &mdash; especially to your heart and circulatory system &mdash; may already be starting. </p>
<p>There's good news, however. Prediabetes can be an opportunity for you to improve your health, because progression from prediabetes to type 2 diabetes isn't inevitable. With healthy lifestyle changes &mdash; such as eating healthy foods, including physical activity in your daily routine and maintaining a healthy weight &mdash; you may be able to bring your blood sugar level back to normal. </p>



PEDIATRIC-WHITE-BLOOD-CELL-DISORDERS
definition


<p>Your body produces white blood cells (leukocytes), which help fight bacterial infections, viruses and fungi. If your child has too few or too many white blood cells, in general, here's what it means:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Low white blood cell count (leukopenia)</strong> means having too few leukocytes circulating in the blood. A long-term low white blood cell count increases the risk of infections and may be caused by a number of different diseases and conditions.</li>
    <li><strong>High white blood cell count (leukocytosis)</strong> means having too many leukocytes circulating in the blood, usually from having an infection. A number of different diseases and conditions may cause a long-term high white blood cell count.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are several types of white blood cells, each with a different disease-fighting activity. The main types are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Neutrophils</li>
    <li>Lymphocytes</li>
    <li>Monocytes</li>
    <li>Eosinophils</li>
    <li>Basophils</li>
</ul>
<p>White blood cells disorders involving a specific type of white blood cell include:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Neutropenia.</strong> Neutropenia (noo-troe-PEE-nee-uh) is a low number of neutrophils, a type of white blood cell that fights infections of fungi and bacteria. Neutropenia can be caused by cancer or by diseases, disorders or infections that damage bone marrow. In addition, certain medications and other diseases or conditions can cause neutropenia.</li>
    <li><strong>Lymphocytopenia.</strong> Lymphocytopenia (lim-foe-sie-toe-PEE-nee-uh) is a decrease in lymphocytes, the type of white blood cell that, among other tasks, protects your body from viral infections. Lymphocytopenia can result from an inherited syndrome, be associated with certain diseases, or be a side effect from medications or other treatments.</li>
    <li><strong>Monocyte disorders.</strong> Monocytes help get rid of dead or damaged tissue and regulate your body's immune response. Infections, cancer, autoimmune diseases and other conditions can cause an increased number of monocytes. A decreased number can be the result of toxins, chemotherapy and other causes.</li>
    <li><strong>Eosinophilia.</strong> Eosinophilia (e-o-sin-o-FIL-e-uh) is a higher than normal number of eosinophil cells, a type of disease-fighting white blood cell. Eosinophilia can be caused by a variety of conditions and disorders, most commonly by an allergic reaction or a parasitic infection.</li>
    <li><strong>Basophilic disorders.</strong> Basophils account for only a small number of white blood cells, but they have a role in wound healing, infection and allergic reactions. A decreased number of basophils can result from high thyroid hormone levels, allergic reactions or infections. An increased number can be caused by certain types of blood cancer, low thyroid hormone levels or other disorders.</li>
</ul>



EBOLA-VIRUS
definition


<p>Ebola virus and Marburg virus are related viruses that cause hemorrhagic fevers &mdash; illnesses marked by severe bleeding (hemorrhage), organ failure and, in many cases, death. Both viruses are native to Africa, where sporadic outbreaks have occurred for decades.</p>
<p>Ebola virus and Marburg virus live in animal hosts, and humans can contract the viruses from infected animals. After the initial transmission, the viruses can spread from person to person through contact with body fluids or contaminated needles.</p>
<p>No drug has been approved to treat either virus. People diagnosed with Ebola or Marburg virus receive supportive care and treatment for complications. Scientists are coming closer to developing vaccines for these deadly diseases.</p>
<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention monitors the United States for conditions such as Ebola infection, and its labs can test for the Ebola virus. Mayo Clinic does not test for the Ebola and Marburg viruses.</p>



SHAKEN-BABY-SYNDROME
definition


<p>Shaken baby syndrome &mdash; also known as abusive head trauma, shaken impact syndrome, inflicted head injury or whiplash shake syndrome &mdash; is a serious brain injury resulting from forcefully shaking an infant or toddler. Shaken baby syndrome destroys a child's brain cells and prevents his or her brain from getting enough oxygen. Shaken baby syndrome is a form of child abuse that can result in permanent brain damage or death. </p>
<p>Shaken baby syndrome is preventable. Help is available for parents who are at risk of harming a child. Parents also can educate other caregivers about the dangers of shaken baby syndrome. </p>

BEE-STINGS
definition


<p>Bee stings are a common outdoor nuisance. In most cases, bee stings are just annoying, and home treatment is all that's necessary to ease the pain of bee stings. But if you're allergic to bee stings or you get stung numerous times, you may have a more serious reaction that requires emergency treatment.</p>
<p>You can take several steps to avoid bee stings &mdash; as well as hornet and wasp stings &mdash; and find out how to treat them if you do get stung.</p>



CYCLOSPORA
definition


<p>Cyclospora infection causes watery, and sometimes explosive, diarrhea. The one-celled parasite that causes cyclospora infection can enter your body when you ingest contaminated food or water. Fresh produce is the culprit in many cases of cyclospora infection. </p>
<p>Because diarrhea can be caused by many things, it can be difficult to diagnose cyclospora infection. A specialized test is required to identify the cyclospora parasite in stool samples. Treatment for cyclospora infection is antibiotics. Food safety precautions may help to prevent the disease. </p>



DOUBLE-UTERUS
definition


<p>In a female fetus, the uterus starts out as two small tubes. As the fetus develops, the tubes normally join to create one larger, hollow organ &mdash; the uterus. Sometimes, however, the tubes don't join completely. Instead, each one develops into a separate structure. This condition is called double uterus (uterus didelphys). A double uterus may have one opening (cervix) into one vagina, or each uterine cavity may have a cervix. There may even be two vaginas. </p>
<p>Double uterus is rare &mdash; and sometimes never diagnosed. The percentage of women with a double uterus is likely higher in those with a history of miscarriage or premature birth. </p>
<p>Treatment is needed only if a double uterus causes symptoms or complications, such as pelvic pain, repeated miscarriages or preterm labor. </p>



PULMONARY-VALVE-DISEASE
definition


<p>Pulmonary valve disease refers to any disorder of your heart's pulmonary valve, which is responsible for keeping blood from your heart flowing properly to your lungs. Pulmonary valve disease can refer to a leaky valve (pulmonary regurgitation) or a narrowed valve (pulmonary stenosis). Treatment depends on the type of pulmonary valve disease you have and its severity.</p>

LYMPHEDEMA
definition


<p>Lymphedema refers to swelling that generally occurs in one of your arms or legs. Although lymphedema tends to affect just one arm or leg, sometimes both arms or both legs may be swollen.</p>
<p>Lymphedema is caused by a blockage in your lymphatic system, an important part of your immune and circulatory systems. The blockage prevents lymph fluid from draining well, and as the fluid builds up, the swelling continues. Lymphedema is most commonly caused by the removal of or damage to your lymph nodes as a part of cancer treatment.</p>
<p>There's no cure for lymphedema, but it can be controlled. Controlling lymphedema involves diligent care of your affected limb.</p>



PROSTATITIS
definition


<p>Prostatitis is swelling and inflammation of the prostate gland, a walnut-sized gland located directly below the bladder in men. The prostate gland produces fluid (semen) that nourishes and transports sperm.</p>
<p>Prostatitis often causes painful or difficult urination. Other symptoms of prostatitis include pain in the groin, pelvic area or genitals and sometimes flu-like symptoms.</p>
<p>Prostatitis affects men of all ages but tends to be more common in men 50 years of age or younger. Prostatitis can be caused by a number of different things. If it's caused by a bacterial infection, it can usually be treated with antibiotics. However, sometimes prostatitis isn't caused by a bacterial infection or an exact cause is never identified.</p>
<p>Depending on the cause, prostatitis may come on gradually or suddenly. It may get better quickly, either on its own or with treatment. Some types of prostatitis last for months or keep recurring (chronic prostatitis).</p>

DEPRESSION
definition


<p>Depression is a mood disorder that causes a persistent feeling of sadness and loss of interest. Also called major depression, major depressive disorder or clinical depression, it affects how you feel, think and behave and can lead to a variety of emotional and physical problems. You may have trouble doing normal day-to-day activities, and depression may make you feel as if life isn't worth living.</p>
<p>More than just a bout of the blues, depression isn't a weakness, nor is it something that you can simply "snap out" of. Depression may require long-term treatment. But don't get discouraged. Most people with depression feel better with medication, psychological counseling or both. Other treatments also may help.</p>



COLIC
definition


<p>Colic is a frustrating condition marked by predictable periods of significant distress in an otherwise well-fed, healthy baby. Babies with colic often cry more than three hours a day, three days a week for three weeks or longer. Nothing you do to try to help your baby during these episodes seems to bring any relief.</p>
<p>Colic can be distressing for both you and your baby. But take comfort: Colic is relatively short-lived. In a matter of weeks or months, the colic will end, and you'll have weathered one of the first major challenges of parenthood.</p>



AMPULLARY-CANCER
definition


<p>Ampullary (AM-poo-la-ree) cancer is a rare cancer that forms in an area of your digestive system called the ampulla of Vater. The ampulla of Vater is where your bile duct and pancreatic duct join and empty into your small intestine.</p>
<p>Ampullary cancer forms near many other parts of the digestive system, such as the liver, pancreas and small intestine. When ampullary cancer grows, it may affect these other organs.</p>
<p>Ampullary cancer treatment often involves extensive surgery to remove the cancer and a large margin of healthy tissue.</p>

HEPATITIS-A
definition


<p>Hepatitis A is a highly contagious liver infection caused by the hepatitis A virus. The virus is one of several types of hepatitis viruses that cause inflammation and affect your liver's ability to function.</p>
<p>You're most likely to contract hepatitis A from contaminated food or water or from close contact with someone who's infected. Mild cases of hepatitis A don't require treatment, and most people who are infected recover completely with no permanent liver damage.</p>
<p>Practicing good hygiene, including washing hands frequently, is one of the best ways to protect against hepatitis A. Vaccines are available for people most at risk.</p>



TULAREMIA
definition


<p>Tularemia is a rare infectious disease that can attack the skin, eyes, lymph nodes, lungs and, less often, other internal organs. Often called rabbit fever or deer fly fever, tularemia is caused by the bacterium Francisella tularensis. The disease mainly affects mammals, especially rodents, rabbits and hares, although it can also infect birds, reptiles and fish. </p>
<p>Tularemia spreads to humans through several routes, including insect bites and direct exposure to an infected animal. Highly contagious and potentially fatal, tularemia usually can be treated effectively with specific antibiotics if diagnosed early.</p>

BULLOUS-PEMPHIGOID
definition


<p>Bullous pemphigoid (BUL-us PEM-fih-goid) is a rare skin condition that causes large, fluid-filled blisters on areas of skin that often flex &mdash; such as the lower abdomen, upper thighs or armpits. Bullous pemphigoid is most common in people older than age 60. </p>
<p>Bullous pemphigoid occurs when your immune system attacks a thin layer of tissue below your outer layer of skin. The reason for this abnormal immune response is unknown, although it sometimes can be triggered by taking certain medications. </p>
<p>Treatment usually includes corticosteroids, such as prednisone, and other drugs that suppress the immune system. Bullous pemphigoid can be life-threatening, especially for older people who are already in poor health. </p>

<p>Traumatic brain injury occurs when an external mechanical force causes brain dysfunction.</p>
<p>Traumatic brain injury usually results from a violent blow or jolt to the head or body. An object penetrating the skull, such as a bullet or shattered piece of skull, also can cause traumatic brain injury.</p>
<p>Mild traumatic brain injury may cause temporary dysfunction of brain cells. More serious traumatic brain injury can result in bruising, torn tissues, bleeding and other physical damage to the brain that can result in long-term complications or death.</p>



EHRLICHIOSIS
definition


<p>Ehrlichiosis is a bacterial illness transmitted by ticks that causes flu-like symptoms. The signs and symptoms of ehrlichiosis range from mild body aches to severe fever and usually appear within a week or two of a tick bite. If treated quickly with appropriate antibiotics, ehrlichiosis generally improves within a few days. </p>
<p>Another tick-borne infection &mdash; anaplasmosis &mdash; is closely related to ehrlichiosis. But the two have distinct differences and are caused by different microorganisms. </p>
<p>The best way to prevent these infections is to avoid tick bites. Tick repellents, thorough body checks after being outside and proper removal of ticks give you the best chance of avoiding ehrlichiosis.</p>



BRUXISM
definition


<p>Bruxism (BRUK-siz-um) is a condition in which you grind, gnash or clench your teeth. If you have bruxism, you may unconsciously clench your teeth together during the day, or clench or grind them at night (sleep bruxism).</p>
<p>Sleep bruxism is considered a sleep-related movement disorder. People who clench or grind their teeth (brux) during sleep are more likely to have other sleep disorders, such as snoring and pauses in breathing (sleep apnea).</p>
<p>Mild bruxism may not require treatment. However, in some people, bruxism can be frequent and severe enough to lead to jaw disorders, headaches, damaged teeth and other problems.</p>
<p>Because you may have sleep bruxism and be unaware of it until complications develop, it's important to know the signs and symptoms of bruxism and to seek regular dental care.</p>



SORE-THROAT
definition


<p>A sore throat is pain, scratchiness or irritation of the throat that often worsens when you swallow. </p>
<p>A sore throat is the primary symptom of pharyngitis &mdash; inflammation of the throat (pharynx). But the terms "sore throat" and "pharyngitis" are often used interchangeably. </p>
<p>The most common cause of a sore throat is a viral infection, such as a cold or the flu. A sore throat caused by a virus resolves on its own with at-home care. Strep throat (streptococcal infection), a less common type of sore throat caused by bacteria, requires additional treatment with antibiotic drugs to prevent complications. </p>
<p>Other less common causes of sore throat may require more complex treatment. </p>



HIP-DYSPLASIA
definition


<p>Hip dysplasia is the medical term for a hip socket that doesn't fully cover the ball portion of the upper thighbone. Most people with hip dysplasia are born with the condition. If hip dysplasia is diagnosed in early infancy, a brace can usually correct the problem. Some people with hip dysplasia don't develop symptoms until later in life. In those cases, surgery may eventually be needed to reduce pain and improve function.</p>



MIGRAINE-HEADACHE
definition


<p>A migraine headache can cause intense throbbing or a pulsing sensation in one area of the head and is commonly accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and extreme sensitivity to light and sound.</p>
<p>Migraine attacks can cause significant pain for hours to days and be so severe that all you can think about is finding a dark, quiet place to lie down.</p>
<p>Some migraines are preceded or accompanied by sensory warning symptoms (aura), such as flashes of light, blind spots, or tingling in your arm or leg.</p>
<p>Medications can help reduce the frequency and severity of migraines. If treatment hasn't worked for you in the past, talk to your doctor about trying a different migraine headache medication. The right medicines, combined with self-help remedies and lifestyle changes, may make a big difference.</p>



MALARIA
definition


<p>Malaria is a disease caused by a parasite, transmitted by the bite of infected mosquitoes. Malaria produces recurrent attacks of chills and fever. Malaria kills an estimated 1 million people each year worldwide.</p>
<p>While the disease is uncommon in temperate climates, malaria is still prevalent in tropical and subtropical countries. World health officials are trying to reduce the incidence of malaria by distributing bed nets to help protect people from mosquito bites as they sleep. Scientists around the world are working to develop a vaccine to prevent malaria.</p>
<p>If you're traveling to locations where malaria is common, take preventive medicine before, during and after your trip. Many malaria parasites are now immune to the most common drugs used to treat the disease.</p>



DISLOCATED-SHOULDER
definition


<p>A dislocated shoulder is an injury in which your upper arm bone pops out of the cup-shaped socket that's part of your shoulder blade. The shoulder is the body's most mobile joint, which makes it susceptible to dislocation.</p>
<p>If you suspect a dislocated shoulder, seek prompt medical attention. Most people regain full shoulder function within a few weeks. However, once you've had a dislocated shoulder, your joint may become unstable and be prone to repeat dislocations.</p>



PELVIC-ORGAN-PROLAPSE
definition


<p>When the muscles and ligaments supporting a woman's pelvic organs weaken, the pelvic organs can slip out of place (prolapse). Pelvic organ prolapse can worsen over time, and you may need surgery to fix it. There are different types of pelvic organ prolapse. Some women develop pelvic organ prolapse after childbirth, a hysterectomy or menopause.</p>
<p>Read more about anterior prolapse (<a href="http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/cystocele/DS00665">cystocele</a>), posterior prolapse (<a href="http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/rectocele/DS00704">rectocele</a>), <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/uterine-prolapse/DS00700">uterine prolapse</a>, and small bowel prolapse (<a href="http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/enterocele/DS00765">enterocele</a>).</p>



BULIMIA
definition


<p>Bulimia (boo-LEE-me-uh) nervosa, commonly called bulimia, is a serious, potentially life-threatening eating disorder. People with bulimia may secretly binge &mdash; eating large amounts of food &mdash; and then purge, trying to get rid of the extra calories in an unhealthy way. For example, someone with bulimia may force vomiting or do excessive exercise. Sometimes people purge after eating only a small snack or a normal-size meal. </p>
<p>Bulimia can be categorized in two ways: </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Purging bulimia.</strong> You regularly self-induce vomiting or misuse laxatives, diuretics or enemas after bingeing. </li>
    <li><strong>Nonpurging bulimia.</strong> You use other methods to rid yourself of calories and prevent weight gain, such as fasting, strict dieting or excessive exercise. </li>
</ul>
<p>However, these behaviors often overlap, and the attempt to rid yourself of extra calories is usually referred to as purging, no matter what the method. </p>
<p>If you have bulimia, you're probably preoccupied with your weight and body shape, and may judge yourself severely and harshly for your self-perceived flaws. Because it's related to self-image &mdash; and not just about food &mdash; bulimia can be difficult to overcome. But effective treatment can help you feel better about yourself, adopt healthier eating patterns and reverse serious complications. </p>

MALE-INFERTILITY
definition


<p>Approximately 15 percent of couples are infertile. This means they aren't able to conceive a child even though they've had frequent, unprotected sexual intercourse for a year or longer. In about half of these couples, male infertility plays a role.</p>
<p>Male infertility is due to low sperm production, abnormal sperm function or blockages that prevent the delivery of sperm. Illnesses, injuries, chronic health problems, lifestyle choices and other factors can play a role in causing male infertility.</p>
<p>Not being able to conceive a child can be stressful and frustrating, but a number of male infertility treatments are available.</p>

<p>Hair loss (alopecia) can affect just your scalp or your entire body. It can be the result of heredity, certain medications or an underlying medical condition. Anyone &mdash; men, women and children &mdash; can experience hair loss.</p>
<p>Baldness typically refers to excessive hair loss from your scalp. Some people prefer to let their baldness run its course untreated and unhidden. Others may cover it up with hairstyles, makeup, hats or scarves. And still others choose one of the medications or surgical procedures that are available to treat hair loss.</p>
<p>Before pursuing any treatment option, talk with your doctor about the cause of and best possible treatments for your particular type of hair loss.</p>



SYSTEMIC-MASTOCYTOSIS
definition


<p>Systemic mastocytosis (mas-to-sy-TOE-sis) is a disorder caused by a genetic mutation that results in an excessive number of mast cells in your body. Mast cells normally help protect you from disease and aid in wound healing by releasing substances such as histamine and leukotrienes. But if you have systemic mastocytosis, excess mast cells can build up in your skin, around blood vessels, in your respiratory, gastrointestinal and urinary tracts, or in reproductive organs. When triggered, these mast cells release substances that can overwhelm your body and result in symptoms such as facial flushing, itching, a rapid heartbeat, abdominal cramps, lightheadedness or even loss of consciousness. Common triggers include alcohol, temperature changes, spicy foods and certain medications.</p>
<p>Several types of systemic mastocytosis exist. The most common form &mdash; indolent systemic mastocytosis &mdash; progresses slowly. The second most common form is systemic mastocytosis associated with a second blood disorder. Another type, aggressive systemic mastocytosis, develops rapidly and is often associated with organ damage. Mast cell leukemia and mast cell sarcoma are extremely rare forms of systemic mastocytosis.</p>



PEDIATRIC-THROMBOCYTOPENIA
definition


<p>Platelets (thrombocytes) are small pieces of cells that play an important role in blood clotting by clumping and forming plugs when necessary. Thrombocytopenia (throm-boe-sie-toe-PEE-nee-uh) is a condition in which blood doesn't clot properly because there aren't enough platelets.</p>
<p>Causes of thrombocytopenia include increased breakdown and destruction of platelets (related to a problem with the immune system), reduced production of platelets or trapping of platelets in the spleen.</p>
<p>Thrombocytopenia can occur as a result of another condition or disorder, such as disseminated intravascular coagulation or DIC (blood clotting problem), leukemia, lymphoma, bone marrow failure (aplastic anemia), an immune system problem, some viruses or certain genetic conditions. It can also occur from sepsis, which is a potentially life-threatening complication of an infection, or as a medication side effect or from exposure to certain toxic chemicals.</p>
<p>The most common reason for thrombocytopenia in children is idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), also called immune system thrombocytopenia. Idiopathic means unknown cause.</p>
<p>ITP occurs when the immune system mistakenly attacks and destroys platelets. Recent viral infections can lead to short-term ITP in children. If ITP in children lasts longer than six months, it's known as chronic ITP.</p>

FIBROADENOMA
definition


<p>Fibroadenomas (fy-broe-ad-uh-NO-muhz) are solid, noncancerous breast tumors that occur most often in adolescent girls and women under the age of 30. </p>
<p>You might describe a fibroadenoma as firm, smooth, rubbery or hard with a well-defined shape. Usually painless, a fibroadenoma might feel like a marble in your breast, moving easily under your skin when touched. Fibroadenomas vary in size, and they can get bigger or even shrink on their own. </p>
<p>Fibroadenomas are among the most common breast lumps in young women. Treatment may include monitoring to detect changes in the size or feel of the fibroadenoma, a biopsy to evaluate the lump, or surgery to remove it.</p>



PREECLAMPSIA
definition


<p>Preeclampsia is a pregnancy complication characterized by high blood pressure and signs of damage to another organ system, often the kidneys. Preeclampsia usually begins after 20 weeks of pregnancy in a woman whose blood pressure had been normal. Even a slight rise in blood pressure may be a sign of preeclampsia.</p>

<p>Left untreated, preeclampsia can lead to serious &mdash; even fatal &mdash; complications for both you and your baby. If you have preeclampsia, the only cure is delivery of your baby.</p>

<p>If you're diagnosed with preeclampsia too early in your pregnancy to deliver your baby, you and your doctor face a challenging task. Your baby needs more time to mature, but you need to avoid putting yourself or your baby at risk of serious complications.</p>

INFECTIOUS-DISEASES
definition


<p>Infectious diseases are disorders caused by organisms &mdash; such as bacteria, viruses, fungi or parasites. Many organisms live in and on our bodies. They're normally harmless or even helpful, but under certain conditions, some organisms may cause disease.</p>
<p>Some infectious diseases can be passed from person to person. Some are transmitted by bites from insects or animals. And others are acquired by ingesting contaminated food or water or being exposed to organisms in the environment.</p>
<p>Signs and symptoms vary depending on the organism causing the infection, but often include fever and fatigue. Mild complaints may respond to rest and home remedies, while some life-threatening infections may require hospitalization.</p>
<p>Many infectious diseases, such as measles and chickenpox, can be prevented by vaccines. Frequent and thorough hand-washing also helps protect you from infectious diseases.</p>



BACK-PAIN
definition


<p>Back pain is a common complaint. Most people in the United States will experience low back pain at least once during their lives. Back pain is one of the most common reasons people go to the doctor or miss work. </p>
<p>On the bright side, you can take measures to prevent or lessen most back pain episodes. If prevention fails, simple home treatment and proper body mechanics will often heal your back within a few weeks and keep it functional for the long haul. Surgery is rarely needed to treat back pain. </p>



RETINAL-DISEASES
definition


<p>The retina is a thin layer of tissue on the inside back wall of your eye, containing millions of light-sensitive cells and other nerve cells that receive and organize visual information. Your retina sends this information to the brain through your optic nerve, enabling you to see.</p>
<p>Retinal diseases can affect the area of the retina that serves your central vision (the macula and the fovea at the center of the macula). Many retinal diseases share common symptoms and treatments, but each has unique characteristics. The goal of retinal disease treatments is to stop or slow disease progression and preserve, improve or restore vision.</p>



NOROVIRUS
definition


<p>Norovirus infection can cause the sudden onset of severe vomiting and diarrhea. The virus is highly contagious and commonly spread through food or water that is contaminated by fecal matter during preparation. You can also be infected through close contact with an infected person. </p>
<p>Diarrhea, abdominal pain and vomiting typically begin 24 to 48 hours after exposure. Norovirus symptoms last one to three days, and most people recover completely without treatment. However, for some people &mdash; especially infants, older adults and people with underlying disease &mdash; vomiting and diarrhea can be severely dehydrating and require medical attention.</p>
<p>Norovirus infection occurs most frequently in closed and crowded environments such as hospitals, nursing homes, schools and cruise ships.</p>



CRANIOPHARYNGIOMA
definition


<p>Craniopharyngioma is a rare type of noncancerous (benign) brain tumor.</p>
<p>Craniopharyngioma begins near the brain's pituitary gland, which secretes hormones that control many body functions. As a craniopharyngioma slowly grows, it can affect the function of the pituitary gland and other nearby structures in the brain.</p>
<p>Craniopharyngioma can occur at any age, but it occurs most often in young children and older adults.</p>



LOW-BLOOD-PRESSURE
definition


<p>Low blood pressure (hypotension) would seem to be something to strive for. However, for many people, low blood pressure can cause symptoms of dizziness and fainting. In severe cases, low blood pressure can be life-threatening.</p>
<p>Although blood pressure varies from person to person, a blood pressure reading of 90 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) or less systolic blood pressure (the top number in a blood pressure reading) or 60 mm Hg or less diastolic blood pressure (the bottom number) is generally considered low blood pressure.</p>
<p>The causes of low blood pressure can range from dehydration to serious medical or surgical disorders. Low blood pressure is treatable, but it's important to find out what's causing your condition so that it can be properly treated.</p>



HYPOCHONDRIA
definition


<p>When you have hypochondria, you become obsessed with the idea that you have a serious or life-threatening disease that hasn't been diagnosed yet. This causes significant anxiety that goes on for months or longer, even though there's no clear medical evidence that you have a serious health problem. Hypochondria is also called hypochondriasis. </p>
<p>While having some anxiety about your health is normal, full-blown hypochondria is so consuming that it causes problems with work, relationships or other areas of your life. Severe hypochondria can be completely disabling. </p>
<p>Although hypochondria is a long-term condition, you don't have to live your life constantly worrying about your health. Treatment such as psychological counseling, medications or simply learning about hypochondria may help ease your worries. </p>



ARTERIOVENOUS-FISTULA
definition


<p>An arteriovenous (AV) fistula is an abnormal connection between an artery and a vein. Normally, blood flows from your arteries to your capillaries to your veins. Nutrients and oxygen in your blood travel from your capillaries to tissues in your body. </p>
<p>With an arteriovenous fistula, blood flows directly from an artery into a vein, bypassing some capillaries. When this happens, tissues below the bypassed capillaries receive less blood supply. </p>
<p>Arteriovenous fistulas usually occur in the legs, but can develop anywhere in the body. Arteriovenous fistulas are often surgically created for use in dialysis in people with severe kidney disease. </p>
<p>A large untreated arteriovenous fistula can lead to serious complications. If you've had an arteriovenous fistula created for dialysis, your doctors will monitor you for complications. </p>

EARWAX-BLOCKAGE
definition


<p>Earwax blockage occurs when earwax (cerumen) accumulates in your ear or becomes too hard to wash away naturally. </p>
<p>Earwax is a helpful and natural part of your body's defenses. It protects your ear canal by trapping dirt and slowing the growth of bacteria. It's not known why some people experience earwax blockage or why earwax blockage often occurs in only one ear. </p>
<p>If earwax blockage becomes a problem, you or your doctor can take simple steps to remove the wax safely.</p>

IRRITABLE-BOWEL-SYNDROME
definition


<p>Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common disorder that affects the large intestine (colon). Irritable bowel syndrome commonly causes cramping, abdominal pain, bloating, gas, diarrhea and constipation. IBS is a chronic condition that you will need to manage long term.</p>
<p>Even though signs and symptoms are uncomfortable, IBS &mdash; unlike ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, which are forms of inflammatory bowel disease &mdash; doesn't cause changes in bowel tissue or increase your risk of colorectal cancer.</p>
<p>Only a small number of people with irritable bowel syndrome have severe signs and symptoms. Some people can control their symptoms by managing diet, lifestyle and stress. Others will need medication and counseling.</p>

<p>Reactive attachment disorder is a rare but serious condition in which an infant or young child doesn't establish healthy attachments with parents or caregivers. Reactive attachment disorder may develop if the child's basic needs for comfort, affection and nurturing aren't met and loving, caring, stable attachments with others are not established.</p>
<p>With treatment, children with reactive attachment disorder may develop more stable and healthy relationships with caregivers and others. Treatments for reactive attachment disorder include positive child and caregiver interactions, a stable, nurturing environment, psychological counseling, and parent or caregiver education.</p>



TYPE-2-DIABETES-IN-CHILDREN
definition


<p>Type 2 diabetes in children is a chronic condition that affects the way your child's body metabolizes sugar (glucose).</p>
<p>Type 2 diabetes is a disease more commonly associated with adults. In fact, it used to be called adult-onset diabetes. But type 2 diabetes in children is on the rise, fueled largely by the obesity epidemic.</p>
<p>There's plenty you can do to help manage or prevent type 2 diabetes in children. Encourage your child to eat healthy foods, get plenty of physical activity and maintain a healthy weight. If diet and exercise aren't enough to control type 2 diabetes in children, oral medication or insulin treatment may be needed.</p>



SCHIZOID-PERSONALITY-DISORDER
definition


<p>Schizoid personality disorder is an uncommon condition in which people avoid social activities and consistently shy away from interaction with others. It affects more males than females. If you have schizoid personality disorder, you may be seen as a loner, and you may lack the desire or skill to form close personal relationships. </p>
<p>To others, you may appear somewhat dull or humorless. Because you don't tend to show emotion, you may appear as though you don't care about what's going on around you. Although you may seem aloof, you may actually feel lonely, even if it's hard for you to acknowledge. Or you may feel much more at ease being alone, and feel comfortable with your life. </p>
<p>The cause of schizoid personality disorder is unknown. Therapy and &mdash; in some cases &mdash; medications can help. </p>

SACROILIITIS
definition


<p>Sacroiliitis (say-kroe-il-e-I-tis) is an inflammation of one or both of your sacroiliac joints &mdash; the places where your lower spine and pelvis connect. Sacroiliitis can cause pain in your buttocks or lower back, and may even extend down one or both legs. The pain associated with sacroiliitis is often aggravated by prolonged standing or by stair climbing. </p>
<p>Sacroiliitis can be difficult to diagnose, because it may be mistaken for other causes of low back pain. It's been linked to a group of diseases that cause inflammatory arthritis of the spine. Treatment of sacroiliitis may involve a combination of rest, physical therapy and medications. </p>



DUMPING-SYNDROME
definition


<p>Dumping syndrome is a group of symptoms that are most likely to develop if you've had surgery to remove all or part of your stomach, or if your stomach has been surgically bypassed to help lose weight. Also called rapid gastric emptying, dumping syndrome occurs when the undigested contents of your stomach move too rapidly into your small bowel. Common symptoms include abdominal cramps, nausea and diarrhea. </p>
<p>Most people with dumping syndrome experience symptoms soon after eating. In others, symptoms may occur one to three hours after eating. Some people experience both early and late symptoms. </p>
<p>Dumping syndrome is managed by adjusting your diet. In more-serious cases of dumping syndrome, you may need medications or surgery.</p>



CONGENITAL-HEART-DISEASE
definition


<p>Congenital heart disease (congenital heart defect) is an abnormality in your heart's structure that you're born with. Although congenital heart disease is often considered a childhood condition, advances in surgical treatment mean most babies who once died of congenital heart disease survive well into adulthood.</p>
<p>While medical advances have improved, many adults with congenital heart disease may not be getting proper follow-up care. If you had a congenital heart defect repaired as an infant, you likely still need care as an adult.</p>
<p>Find out if and when you should check with your doctor, if you're likely to have complications, or if you're at greater risk of other heart problems as an adult.</p>



GENITAL-WARTS
definition


<p>Genital warts are one of the most common types of sexually transmitted infections. At least half of all sexually active people will become infected with human papillomavirus (HPV), the virus that causes genital warts, at some point during their lives. Women are somewhat more likely than men to develop genital warts.</p>
<p>As the name suggests, genital warts affect the moist tissues of the genital area. Genital warts may look like small, flesh-colored bumps or have a cauliflower-like appearance. In many cases, the warts are too small to be visible.</p>
<p>Like warts that appear elsewhere on your body, genital warts are caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV). Some strains of genital HPV can cause genital warts, while others can cause cancer. Vaccines can help protect against certain strains of genital HPV.</p>

SPRAINS-AND-STRAINS
definition


<p>Sprains and strains are common injuries that share similar signs and symptoms, but involve different parts of your body. </p>
<p>A sprain is a stretching or tearing of ligaments &mdash; the tough bands of fibrous tissue that connect one bone to another in your joints. The most common location for a sprain is in your ankle. </p>
<p>A strain is a stretching or tearing of muscle or tendon. A tendon is a fibrous cord of tissue that connects muscles to bones. Strains often occur in the lower back and in the hamstring muscle in the back of your thigh. </p>



EPIDIDYMITIS
definition


<p>Epididymitis is an inflammation of the coiled tube (epididymis) at the back of the testicle that stores and carries sperm. Pain and swelling are the most common signs and symptoms of epididymitis. Males of any age can get epididymitis, but it's most common in men between the ages of 14 and 35. </p>
<p>Epididymitis is most often caused by a bacterial infection or by a sexually transmitted infection (STI), such as gonorrhea or chlamydia. In some cases, the testicle also may become inflamed &mdash; a condition called epididymo-orchitis. </p>



PERICARDITIS
definition


<p>Pericarditis is swelling and irritation of the pericardium, the thin sac-like membrane surrounding your heart. Pericarditis often causes chest pain and sometimes other symptoms. The sharp chest pain associated with pericarditis occurs when the irritated layers of the pericardium rub against each other.</p>
<p>Pericarditis usually begins suddenly but doesn't last long (acute). When symptoms develop more gradually or persist, pericarditis is considered chronic.</p>
<p>Most cases are mild and usually improve on their own. Treatment for more-severe cases may include medications and, rarely, surgery. Early diagnosis and treatment may help to reduce the risk of long-term complications from pericarditis.</p>



ARTERIOVENOUS-MALFORMATION
definition


<p>A brain (intracranial) arteriovenous malformation (AVM) is an abnormal tangle of arteries and veins in your brain. These are congenital lesions, meaning that they can develop before you're born. Arteriovenous malformations can also occur in your spinal cord (<a href="http://www.mayoclinic.org/spinal-arteriovenous-malformations/">spinal arteriovenous malformation</a>).</p>
<p>Oxygen-rich blood normally enters your brain through arteries, which branch into smaller arterioles and even smaller blood vessels (capillaries). Your brain uses oxygen removed from the blood in your capillaries. Oxygen-depleted blood then passes into small venules and then into larger veins that drain the blood from your brain to your heart and lungs.</p>
<p>In a brain arteriovenous malformation, your blood passes directly from your arteries to your veins, bypassing capillaries. The arteries and veins in an AVM can rupture, causing bleeding into the brain.</p>

ENTROPION
definition


<p>Entropion (en-TROH-pe-on) is a condition in which your eyelid turns inward so that your eyelashes and skin rub against the eye surface, causing irritation and discomfort. </p>
<p>When you have entropion, your eyelid may be turned in all the time or it may only turn inward when you blink forcibly or tightly squeeze your eyelids shut. Entropion occurs most often in older adults, and it generally affects only your lower eyelid. </p>
<p>Artificial tears and lubricating ointments can help relieve symptoms of entropion, but you'll often need surgery to correct it. Left untreated, entropion can cause damage to the clear part of your eye (cornea), eye infections and vision loss. </p>

KERATOCONUS
definition


<p>Keratoconus (ker-uh-toe-KOH-nus) occurs when your cornea &mdash; the clear, dome-shaped front surface of your eye &mdash; thins and gradually bulges outward into a cone shape.</p>
<p>A cone-shaped cornea causes blurred vision and may cause sensitivity to light and glare. Keratoconus usually affects both eyes and generally occurs in people ages 10 to 25. The condition may progress slowly for 10 years or longer.</p>
<p>Vision problems can be corrected with glasses or soft contact lenses early on in the condition. As keratoconus progresses, you may have to be fitted with rigid gas permeable contact lenses or other types of contact lenses. Advanced keratoconus may require a cornea transplant.</p>

ROSEOLA
definition


<p>Roseola is a generally mild infection that usually affects children by age 2. It occasionally affects adults. Roseola is so common that most children have been infected with roseola by the time they enter kindergarten. </p>
<p>Two common strains of herpes virus cause roseola. The condition typically causes several days of fever, followed by a rash. </p>
<p>Some children develop only a very mild case of roseola and never show any clear indication of illness, while others experience the full range of symptoms. </p>
<p>Roseola typically isn't serious. Rarely, a very high fever can result in complications. Treatment of roseola includes bed rest, fluids and medications to reduce fever. </p>



COMMON-COLD
definition


<p>The common cold is a viral infection of your upper respiratory tract &mdash; your nose and throat. A common cold is usually harmless, although it may not feel that way at the time. If it's not a runny nose, sore throat and cough, it's the watery eyes, sneezing and congestion &mdash; or maybe all of the above. In fact, because any one of more than 100 viruses can cause a common cold, signs and symptoms tend to vary greatly. </p>
<p>Preschool children are at greatest risk of frequent colds, but even healthy adults can expect to have a few colds each year. </p>
<p>Most people recover from a common cold in about a week or two. If symptoms don't improve, see your doctor. </p>

BLASTOCYSTIS-HOMINIS
definition


<p>Blastocystis hominis is a microscopic parasite sometimes found in the stools of healthy people as well as in the stools of those who have diarrhea, abdominal pain or other gastrointestinal problems. Infection with blastocystis is called blastocystosis. </p>
<p>Researchers don't yet fully understand the role that blastocystis plays, if any, in causing an infection. Certain subtypes of blastocystis may be more likely to cause symptomatic infection, or may pose a risk only when combined with other types of infection. In some cases, blastocystis simply resides in the digestive tract without causing harm. </p>
<p>There are no proven treatments for blastocystosis, and the infection usually clears up on its own. However, if signs and symptoms don't improve, your doctor may recommend trying medications. </p>



DISLOCATED-ELBOW
definition


<p>A dislocated elbow occurs when the bones that make up the joint are forced out of alignment &mdash; typically when a person lands on an outstretched hand during a fall. </p>
<p>Toddlers may experience a dislocated elbow, sometimes known as nursemaid's elbow, if they are lifted or swung by their forearms. </p>
<p>If you or your child has a dislocated elbow, seek immediate medical attention. Complications can occur if the dislocated elbow pinches or traps the blood vessels and nerves that serve the lower arm and hand. </p>
<p>In most cases, a dislocated elbow can be realigned without surgery. However, the impact that caused the elbow to dislocate also can cause bone fractures within the joint, so surgical repair may be necessary. </p>



IRON-DEFICIENCY-ANEMIA
definition


<p>Iron deficiency anemia is a common type of anemia &mdash; a condition in which blood lacks adequate healthy red blood cells. Red blood cells carry oxygen to the body's tissues.</p>
<p>As the name implies, iron deficiency anemia is due to insufficient iron. Without enough iron, your body can't produce enough of a substance in red blood cells that enables them to carry oxygen (hemoglobin). As a result, iron deficiency anemia may leave you tired and short of breath.</p>
<p>You can usually correct iron deficiency anemia with iron supplementation. Sometimes additional tests or treatments for iron deficiency anemia are necessary, especially if your doctor suspects that you're bleeding internally.</p>



SWEATING-AND-BODY-ODOR
definition


<p>Sweating and body odor are facts of life for most people. Heavy perspiration and body odor can happen when you exercise, when you're too warm, or when you're nervous, anxious or under stress.</p>
<p>Your body has two main types of sweat glands, and they produce two very different types of sweat. Both types are odorless, but the type of sweat produced in your armpits and groin smells bad when it combines with bacteria found normally on your skin.</p>
<p>Unusual changes in sweating &mdash; either excessive perspiration (hyperhidrosis) or little or no perspiration (anhidrosis) &mdash; can be cause for concern. Likewise, changes in body odor may be a sign of a medical problem.</p>
<p>For normal sweating and body odor, however, lifestyle and home treatments can effectively manage your symptoms.</p>



WEST-NILE-VIRUS
definition


<p>West Nile infection is caused by a virus transmitted by mosquitoes. Most people infected with West Nile virus don't experience any signs or symptoms, or may experience only minor ones, such as fever and mild headache. However, some people who become infected with West Nile virus develop a life-threatening illness that includes inflammation of the brain. </p>
<p>Mild signs and symptoms of a West Nile virus infection generally go away on their own. But severe signs and symptoms &mdash; such as a severe headache, fever, disorientation or sudden weakness &mdash; require immediate attention. </p>
<p>Exposure to mosquitoes where West Nile virus exists increases your risk of getting West Nile virus infection. Protect yourself from mosquitoes by using mosquito repellent and wearing clothing that covers your skin to reduce your risk.</p>



RENAL-ARTERY-STENOSIS
definition


<p>Renal artery stenosis is the narrowing of one or both arteries that carry blood to your kidneys (renal arteries). Narrowing of the arteries prevents normal amounts of oxygen-rich blood from reaching your kidneys. Your kidneys need adequate blood flow to help filter waste products and remove excess fluids. Reduced blood flow may increase blood pressure and injure kidney tissue.</p>



OSTEOSARCOMA
definition


<p>Osteosarcoma is a type of bone cancer that begins in the cells that form your bones. Osteosarcoma is most often found in the long bones in your arms and legs, though it can occur in any bone.</p>
<p>Osteosarcoma tends to occur in children and young adults, but it can also occur in older adults. Osteosarcoma treatment often involves surgery, chemotherapy and radiation therapy.</p>

BROKEN-NOSE
definition


<p>A broken nose, also called a nasal fracture, is a break or crack in a bone in your nose &mdash; often the bone over the bridge of your nose.</p>
<p>Common causes of a broken nose include contact sports, physical fights, falls and motor vehicle accidents that result in facial trauma. A broken nose can cause pain, along with swelling and bruising around your nose and under your eyes. Your nose may look crooked, and you may have trouble breathing.</p>
<p>Treatment for a broken nose may include procedures that realign your nose. Surgery usually isn't necessary for a broken nose.</p>



ENCOPRESIS
definition


<p>Encopresis, also called stool holding or soiling, occurs when your child resists having bowel movements, causing impacted stool to collect in the colon and rectum. When your child's colon is full of impacted stool, liquid stool can leak around the impacted stool and out of the anus, staining your child's underwear. </p>
<p>Encopresis usually occurs after age 4, when your child has already learned to use a toilet. In most cases, encopresis is a symptom of chronic constipation. Less frequently, it may be the result of developmental or emotional issues.</p>
<p>Doctors categorize encopresis as primary or secondary. Primary encopresis happens in a child who has never been successfully toilet trained. In secondary encopresis, a child develops the condition after having been successfully toilet trained.</p>
<p>Encopresis can be frustrating for you &mdash; and embarrassing for your child. However, with patience and positive reinforcement, treatment for encopresis is usually successful.</p>

HUNTER-SYNDROME
definition


<p>Hunter syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that occurs when an enzyme your body needs is either missing or doesn't work properly. </p>
<p>Because the body doesn't have enough of the enzyme to break down certain complex molecules, the molecules build up in harmful amounts in certain cells and tissues. The buildup that occurs in Hunter syndrome eventually causes permanent, progressive damage affecting appearance, mental development, organ function and physical abilities. </p>
<p>Hunter syndrome appears in children as young as 18 months. It nearly always occurs in males. </p>
<p>There's no cure for Hunter syndrome. Treatment of Hunter syndrome involves management of symptoms and complications. </p>



ITCHY-SKIN
definition


<p>Itchy skin is an uncomfortable, irritating sensation that makes you want to scratch. Also known as pruritus (proo-RIE-tus), itchy skin may be the result of a rash or another condition, such as psoriasis or dermatitis. Or itchy skin may be a symptom of a disease, such as liver disease or kidney failure. </p>
<p>Depending on the cause of your itchy skin, it may appear normal. Or it may be red or rough or have bumps or blisters. </p>
<p>Long-term relief requires identifying and treating the cause of itchy skin. Itchy skin treatments include medications, wet dressings and light therapy. Self-care measures, including using anti-itch products and taking cool baths, also can help. </p>

<p>Acromegaly is a hormonal disorder that develops when your pituitary gland produces too much growth hormone during adulthood. When this happens, your bones increase in size, including those of your hands, feet and face. Acromegaly usually affects middle-aged adults. </p>
<p>In children who are still growing, too much growth hormone can cause a condition called gigantism. These children have exaggerated bone growth and an abnormal increase in height. </p>
<p>Because acromegaly is uncommon and physical changes occur gradually, the condition often isn't recognized immediately; sometimes not for years. If not treated promptly, acromegaly can lead to serious illness and even become life-threatening. However, available treatments for acromegaly can reduce your risk of complications and significantly improve your symptoms, including the enlargement of your features.</p>

PARANEOPLASTIC-SYNDROMES
definition


<p>Paraneoplastic syndromes of the nervous system are a group of rare disorders that develop in some people who have cancer. Paraneoplastic syndromes of the nervous system are the most commonly reported paraneoplastic syndromes, but these syndromes can also affect other organ systems including hormone (endocrine), skin (dermatologic), blood (hematologic) and joints (rheumatologic).</p>
<p>Paraneoplastic events may also in part explain some of the most common symptoms of cancer, such as fatigue, loss of appetite for food (anorexia) and weight loss.</p>
<p>Paraneoplastic syndromes of the nervous system occur when cancer-fighting agents of the immune system also attack parts of the brain, spinal cord, peripheral nerves or muscle. Cancers commonly associated with these disorders include lung, breast and ovarian, as well as cancers of the blood. In most cases, paraneoplastic syndromes of the nervous system occur before a cancer is diagnosed.</p>
<p>Depending on the component of the nervous system affected, paraneoplastic syndromes can cause problems with muscle movement or coordination, sensory perception, memory or thinking skills, or even sleep.</p>
<p>Sometimes the injury to the nervous system is reversible with therapy directed toward the cancer and the immune system. However, these diseases can also rapidly result in severe damage to the nervous system which can't be reversed. Regardless, treatment of the underlying cancer and other interventions may prevent further damage, improve symptoms and give you a better quality of life.</p>



CRADLE-CAP
definition


<p>Cradle cap, the common term for infantile seborrheic dermatitis, causes scaly patches on a baby's scalp. Though cradle cap isn't serious, it can cause thick crusting and white or yellow scales. </p>
<p>Cradle cap usually resolves on its own within a few months. Self-care measures, such as washing your baby's scalp daily with a mild shampoo, can help loosen and remove the cradle cap scales. If cradle cap persists or seems severe, your doctor may suggest a medicated shampoo, lotion or other treatment. </p>



ADJUSTMENT-DISORDERS
definition


<p>Work problems, going away to school, an illness &mdash; any number of life changes can cause stress. Most of the time, people adjust to such changes within a few months. But if you continue to feel down or self-destructive, you may have an adjustment disorder.</p>
<p>An adjustment disorder is a type of stress-related mental illness. You may feel anxious or depressed, or even have thoughts of suicide. Your normal daily routines may feel overwhelming. Or you may make reckless decisions. In essence, you have a hard time adjusting to change in your life, and it has serious consequences.</p>
<p>You don't have to tough it out on your own, though. Adjustment disorder treatment &mdash; usually brief &mdash; is likely to help you regain your emotional footing.</p>



PSEUDOTUMOR-CEREBRI
definition


<p>Pseudotumor cerebri (SOO-doe-too-mur SER-uh-bry) occurs when the pressure inside your skull (intracranial pressure) increases for no obvious reason.</p>
<p>Symptoms mimic those of a brain tumor, but no tumor is present. Pseudotumor cerebri can occur in children and adults, but it's most common in obese women of childbearing age.</p>
<p>When no underlying cause for the increased intracranial pressure can be discovered, pseudotumor cerebri may also be called idiopathic intracranial hypertension. </p>
<p>The increased intracranial pressure associated with pseudotumor cerebri can cause swelling of the optic nerve and result in vision loss. Medications often can reduce this pressure, but in some cases, surgery is necessary.</p>



CHOLESTASIS-OF-PREGNANCY
definition


<p>Cholestasis of pregnancy occurs in late pregnancy and triggers intense itching, usually on the hands and feet but often on many other parts of the body.</p>
<p>Cholestasis of pregnancy can make you intensely uncomfortable but poses no long-term risk to an expectant mother. For a developing baby, however, cholestasis of pregnancy can be dangerous. Doctors usually recommend early delivery.</p>
<p>The term "cholestasis" refers to any condition that impairs the flow of bile &mdash; a digestive fluid &mdash; from the liver. Pregnancy is one of many possible causes of cholestasis. Other names for cholestasis of pregnancy include obstetric cholestasis and intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy.</p>



BONE-METASTASIS
definition


<p>Bone metastasis occurs when cancer cells spread from their original site to a bone. Nearly all types of cancer can spread (metastasize) to the bones. But some types of cancer are particularly likely to spread to bone, including breast cancer and prostate cancer. </p>
<p>Bone metastasis can occur in any bone but more commonly occurs in the pelvis and spine. Bone metastasis may be the first sign that you have cancer, or bone metastasis may occur years after cancer treatment. </p>
<p>Bone metastasis can cause pain and broken bones. With rare exceptions, cancer that has spread to the bones can't be cured. Treatments can help reduce pain and other symptoms of bone metastases. </p>



TAPEWORM
definition


<p>Tapeworm infection is caused by ingesting food or water contaminated with tapeworm eggs or larvae. If you ingest certain tapeworm eggs, they can migrate outside your intestines and form larval cysts in body tissues and organs (invasive infection). If you ingest tapeworm larvae, however, they develop into adult tapeworms in your intestines (intestinal infection). </p>
<p>An adult tapeworm consists of a head, neck and chain of segments called proglottids. When you have an intestinal tapeworm infection, the tapeworm head adheres to the intestine wall, and the proglottids grow and produce eggs. Adult tapeworms can live for up to 20 years in a host. Intestinal tapeworm infections are usually mild, but invasive larval infections can cause serious complications. </p>

THROMBOCYTOSIS
definition


<p>Thrombocytosis (throm-boe-sie-TOE-sis) is a disorder in which your body produces too many platelets (thrombocytes), which play an important role in blood clotting. The disorder is called reactive thrombocytosis when it's caused by an underlying condition, such as an infection. </p>
<p>Thrombocytosis may also be caused by a blood and bone marrow disease. When caused by a bone marrow disorder, thrombocytosis is called autonomous, primary or essential thrombocytosis or essential thrombocythemia. </p>
<p>Your doctor may detect thrombocytosis in routine blood test results that show a high platelet level. If your blood test indicates thrombocytosis, it's important for your doctor to determine whether it's reactive thrombocytosis or if you have thrombocythemia, which is more likely to cause blood clots. </p>



VAGINAL-FISTULAS
definition


<p>A vaginal fistula is an abnormal opening that connects your vagina to another organ, such as your bladder, colon or rectum. Your doctor might describe the condition as a hole in your vagina that allows stool or urine to pass through your vagina.</p>
<p>Vaginal fistulas can develop as a result of an injury, a surgery, an infection or radiation treatment.&nbsp;Whatever the cause of your fistula, you may need to have it closed by a surgeon to restore normal function.</p>
<p>There are several types of vaginal fistulas:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Vesicovaginal fistula.</strong> Also called a bladder fistula, this opening occurs between your vagina and urinary bladder and is the type that doctors see most often.</li>
    <li><strong>Ureterovaginal fistula.</strong> This type of fistula happens when the abnormal opening develops between your vagina and the ducts that carry urine from your kidneys to your bladder (ureters).</li>
    <li><strong>Urethrovaginal fistula.</strong> In this type of fistula, also called a urethral fistula, the opening occurs between your vagina and the tube that carries urine out of your body (urethra).</li>
    <li><strong>Rectovaginal fistula.</strong> In this type of fistula, also known as a rectal fistula, the opening is between your vagina and the lower portion of your large intestine (rectum).</li>
    <li><strong>Colovaginal fistula.</strong> With a colovaginal fistula, the opening occurs between the vagina and colon.</li>
    <li><strong>Enterovaginal fistula.</strong> In this type of fistula, the opening is between the small intestine and the vagina.</li>

DE-QUERVAINS-TENOSYNOVITIS
definition


<p>De Quervain's tenosynovitis (dih-kwer-VAINS ten-oh-sine-oh-VIE-tis) is a painful condition affecting the tendons on the thumb side of your wrist. If you have de Quervain's tenosynovitis, it will probably hurt every time you turn your wrist, grasp anything or make a fist. </p>
<p>Although the exact cause of de Quervain's tenosynovitis isn't known, any activity that relies on repetitive hand or wrist movement &mdash; such as working in the garden, playing golf or racket sports or lifting your baby &mdash; can make it worse. </p>



SLEEP-DISORDERS
definition


<p>Sleep disorders are changes in sleeping patterns or habits. Signs and symptoms of sleep disorders include excessive daytime sleepiness, irregular breathing or increased movement during sleep, difficulty sleeping, and abnormal sleep behaviors.</p>
<p>A sleep disorder can affect your overall health, safety and quality of life. With accurate diagnosis, doctors can treat most sleep disorders effectively.</p>



PET-ALLERGY
definition


<p>Pet allergy is an allergic reaction to proteins found in an animal's skin cells, saliva or urine. Signs of pet allergy include those common to hay fever, such as sneezing and runny nose. Some people may also experience signs of asthma, such as wheezing and difficulty breathing. </p>
<p>Most often, pet allergy is triggered by exposure to the dead flakes of skin (dander) a pet sheds. Any animal with fur can be a source of pet allergy, but pet allergies are most commonly associated with cats, dogs, rodents and horses. </p>
<p>If you have a pet allergy, the best strategy is to avoid or reduce exposure to the animal as much as possible. Medications or other treatments may be necessary to relieve symptoms and manage asthma. </p>



BELLS-PALSY
definition


<p>Bell's palsy causes sudden weakness in your facial muscles. This makes half of your face appear to droop. Your smile is one-sided, and your eye on that side resists closing. </p>
<p>Bell's palsy, also known as facial palsy, can occur at any age. The exact cause is unknown, but it's believed to be the result of swelling and inflammation of the nerve that controls the muscles on one side of your face. It may be a reaction that occurs after a viral infection. </p>
<p>For most people, Bell's palsy is temporary. Symptoms usually start to improve within a few weeks, with complete recovery in about six months. A small number of people continue to have some Bell's palsy symptoms for life. Rarely, Bell's palsy can recur. </p>



TONSILLITIS
definition


<p>Tonsillitis is inflammation of the tonsils, two oval-shaped pads of tissue at the back of the throat &mdash; one tonsil on each side. Signs and symptoms of tonsillitis include swollen tonsils, sore throat, difficulty swallowing and tender lymph nodes on the sides of the neck. </p>
<p>Most cases of tonsillitis are caused by infection with a common virus, but bacterial infections also may cause tonsillitis. </p>
<p>Because appropriate treatment for tonsillitis depends on the cause, it's important to get a prompt and accurate diagnosis. Surgery to remove tonsils, once a common procedure to treat tonsillitis, is usually performed only when tonsillitis occurs frequently, doesn't respond to other treatments or causes serious complications. </p>

PEANUT-ALLERGY
definition


<p>Peanut allergy is common, especially in children. Peanut allergy symptoms can range from a minor irritation to a life-threatening reaction (anaphylaxis). For some people with peanut allergy, even tiny amounts of peanuts can cause a serious reaction. </p>
<p>If you or your child has had a reaction to peanuts, tell your doctor about it. Peanut allergy is one of the most common causes of severe allergy attacks. </p>
<p>It's important to get even a minor reaction to peanuts checked out. Even if you or your child has had only a mild allergic reaction in the past, there's still a risk of a more serious future reaction. </p>



INSOMNIA
definition


<p>Insomnia is a persistent disorder that can make it hard to fall asleep, hard to stay asleep or both, despite the opportunity for adequate sleep. With insomnia, you usually awaken feeling unrefreshed, which takes a toll on your ability to function during the day. Insomnia can sap not only your energy level and mood but also your health, work performance and quality of life.</p>
<p>How much sleep is enough varies from person to person. Most adults need seven to eight hours a night.</p>
<p>Many adults experience insomnia at some point, but some people have long-term (chronic) insomnia. Insomnia may be the primary problem, or it may be secondary due to other causes, such as a disease or medication.</p>
<p>You don't have to put up with sleepless nights. Simple changes in your daily habits can often help.</p>



GASTROINTESTINAL-BLEEDING
definition


<p>Gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding is a symptom of a disorder in your digestive tract. The blood often appears in stool or vomit but isn't always visible. The level of bleeding can range from mild to severe and life-threatening. Finding the cause of GI bleeding can be difficult. But sophisticated imaging technology can usually locate the problem, and minimally invasive procedures often can fix it.</p>



RETROGRADE-EJACULATION
definition


<p>Retrograde ejaculation occurs when semen enters the bladder instead of emerging through the penis during orgasm. Although you still reach sexual climax, you may ejaculate very little or no semen. This is sometimes called a dry orgasm. Retrograde ejaculation isn't harmful, but it can cause male infertility. Treatment for retrograde ejaculation is generally only needed to restore fertility.</p>

GESTATIONAL-DIABETES
definition


<p>Gestational diabetes develops during pregnancy (gestation). Like other types of diabetes, gestational diabetes affects how your cells use sugar (glucose). Gestational diabetes causes high blood sugar that can affect your pregnancy and your baby's health.</p>
<p>Any pregnancy complication is concerning, but there's good news. Expectant moms can help control gestational diabetes by eating healthy foods, exercising and, if necessary, taking medication. Controlling blood sugar can prevent a difficult birth and keep you and your baby healthy.</p>
<p>In gestational diabetes, blood sugar usually returns to normal soon after delivery. But if you've had gestational diabetes, you're at risk for type 2 diabetes. You'll continue working with your health care team to monitor and manage your blood sugar.</p>

COMMON-COLD-IN-BABIES
definition


<p>A common cold is a viral infection of your baby's nose and throat. Nasal congestion and a runny nose are the primary signs of common cold in babies. </p>
<p>Babies are especially susceptible to the common cold, in part because they're often around other older children who don't always wash their hands. Also, they have yet to develop immunity to many common infections. Within the first year of life, most babies have up to seven colds. </p>
<p>Treatment for the common cold in babies involves easing their symptoms, such as by providing plenty of fluids and keeping the air moist. Very young infants must see a doctor at the first sign of the common cold because they're at greater risk of croup and pneumonia. </p>



EGG-ALLERGY
definition


<p>Eggs are one of the most common allergy-causing foods in children. </p>
<p>Egg allergy symptoms usually occur a few minutes to a few hours after eating eggs or foods containing eggs. Signs and symptoms range from mild to severe and can include skin rashes, hives, nasal inflammation, and vomiting or other digestive problems. Rarely, egg allergy can cause anaphylaxis &mdash; a life-threatening reaction. </p>
<p>Egg allergy can occur as early as infancy. Most children outgrow their egg allergy before adolescence. But in some cases, it continues into adulthood. </p>

<p>Tricuspid valve disease is a condition in which the valve between the two right heart chambers (right ventricle and right atrium) doesn't function properly. Tricuspid valve disease often occurs with other heart valve problems.</p>
<p>Several types of tricuspid valve disease exist, including:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Tricuspid valve regurgitation.</strong> In this condition, the tricuspid valve doesn't close properly and blood flows back into your heart's upper right chamber (right atrium).</li>
    <li><strong>Tricuspid valve stenosis.</strong> In this condition, the tricuspid valve is narrowed, decreasing the amount of blood that can flow through it from the right atrium to the right ventricle.</li>
    <li><strong>Tricuspid atresia.</strong> In tricuspid atresia, a condition present at birth (<a href="http://www.mayoclinic.org/congenital-heart/">congenital heart disease</a>), a solid wall of tissue blocks the blood flow between your right heart chambers.</li>
    <li><strong>Ebstein's anomaly.</strong> <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.org/ebsteins-anomaly/">Ebstein's anomaly</a> is a condition in which a malformed tricuspid valve sits lower than normal in the right ventricle, causing blood to flow back into the right atrium (tricuspid regurgitation).</li>

SCHIZOTYPAL-PERSONALITY-DISORDER
definition


<p>People with schizotypal personality disorder are often described as odd or eccentric and usually have few, if any, close relationships. They generally don't understand how relationships form or the impact of their behavior on others. They may also misinterpret others' motivations and behaviors and develop significant distrust of others. </p>
<p>These problems may lead to severe anxiety and a tendency to turn inward in social situations, as the person with schizotypal personality disorder responds inappropriately to social cues and holds peculiar beliefs. </p>
<p>Schizotypal personality disorder typically is diagnosed in early adulthood and likely to endure, though symptoms may improve with age. Medications and therapy also may help. </p>



HHT
definition


<p>Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (tuh-lan-jee-uk-TAY-zhuh), also known as HHT or Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome, is an inherited disorder that affects blood vessels. In most cases, HHT isn't life-threatening. Currently there's no cure, but in many cases the symptoms can be effectively managed.</p>
<p>In people who have HHT, most of the body's blood vessels are normal. But some of the networks of blood vessels that join arteries to veins (capillaries) aren't correctly formed. In small blood vessels, these abnormalities are called telangiectases. When they occur in larger vessels, they're called arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). People who have HHT may have both kinds of malformations.</p>
<p>Telangiectases and AVMs cause health problems because they don't function normally. This can lead to a variety of symptoms depending on where the blood vessel abnormality is located. In some areas of the body &mdash; especially the lungs, brain and liver &mdash; these blood vessel abnormalities can be serious because they may bleed, don't allow for adequate oxygen levels in the blood, and can increase your risk of brain infections and stroke. Nosebleeds and bleeding within the intestines can also lead to anemia. The severity of HHT often varies significantly from person to person, even within the same family.</p>

<p>Soggy sheets and pajamas &mdash; and an embarrassed child &mdash; are a familiar scene in many homes. But don't despair. Bed-wetting isn't a sign of toilet training gone bad. It's often just a normal part of a child's development. </p>
<p>Bed-wetting is also known as nighttime incontinence or nocturnal enuresis. Generally, bed-wetting before age 6 or 7 isn't cause for concern. At this age, your child may still be developing nighttime bladder control. </p>
<p>If bed-wetting continues, treat the problem with patience and understanding. Bladder training, moisture alarms or medication may help reduce bed-wetting. </p>



VASCULITIS
definition


<p>Vasculitis is an inflammation of your blood vessels. Vasculitis causes changes in the walls of your blood vessels, including thickening, weakening, narrowing and scarring. </p>
<p>There are many types of vasculitis. Some forms last only a short time (acute) while others are long lasting (chronic). Vasculitis, which is also known as angiitis and arteritis, can be so severe that the tissues and organs supplied by the affected vessels don't get enough blood. This shortage of blood can result in organ and tissue damage, even death. </p>
<p>Vasculitis can affect anyone, though some types of vasculitis are more common among certain groups. Some forms of vasculitis improve on their own, but others require treatment &mdash; often including taking medications for an extended period of time. </p>



KERATITIS
definition


<p>Keratitis is an inflammation of the cornea &mdash; the clear, dome-shaped tissue on the front of your eye that covers the pupil and iris. Keratitis may or may not be associated with an infection. Noninfectious keratitis can be caused by a relatively minor injury, wearing your contact lenses too long or other diseases. Infectious keratitis can be caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites. </p>
<p>If you have eye redness or other symptoms of keratitis, make an appointment to see your doctor. With prompt attention, mild to moderate cases of keratitis can usually be effectively treated without loss of vision. If left untreated, or if an infection is severe, keratitis can lead to serious complications that may permanently damage your vision. </p>



PRETERM-LABOR
definition


<p>A full-term pregnancy lasts about 40 weeks. Preterm labor occurs when contractions begin to open your cervix before 37 weeks of pregnancy. </p>
<p>If preterm labor can't be stopped, your baby will be born early. The earlier premature birth happens, the greater the health risks for your baby. Many premature babies (preemies) need special care in the neonatal intensive care unit. Preemies can also have long-term mental and physical disabilities. In addition, giving birth prematurely increases your risk of preterm labor in future pregnancies. </p>
<p>While the specific cause of preterm labor often isn't clear, certain risk factors can increase the risk of preterm labor. Find out if you're at risk of preterm labor and what you can do to prevent it. </p>

<p>Rocky Mountain spotted fever is a tick-borne bacterial disease that affects the cells in the lining of your blood vessels, making the vessels leak. This can eventually cause serious damage to internal organs, particularly your kidneys. </p>
<p>Although it was first identified in the Rocky Mountains, Rocky Mountain spotted fever is most commonly found in the southeastern part of the United States. It also occurs in parts of Canada, Mexico, Central America and South America. </p>
<p>Early signs and symptoms of Rocky Mountain spotted fever include severe headache and high fever. A few days later, a rash usually appears on the wrists and ankles. Rocky Mountain spotted fever responds well to prompt treatment with antibiotics. If left untreated, however, the disease can cause serious complications and even death.</p>



SUSPICIOUS-BREAST-LUMPS
definition


<p>A breast lump is a growth of tissue that develops within your breast. Finding a lump in your breast can be frightening. Most breast lumps aren't dangerous, but it's important to see your doctor to have them evaluated promptly.</p>
<p>Breast lumps can result from:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Breast cysts.</strong> If you find a breast lump that feels round, smooth and firm, it could be a cyst &mdash; a dilated milk duct filled with fluid. A breast cyst can be large or small, and the surrounding breast tissue may be tender. A breast cyst may appear before your menstrual period and get smaller or disappear afterward.</li>
    <li><strong>Fibrocystic breast changes.</strong> With fibrocystic breast changes, you may feel fullness in your breasts with areas of lumpiness and tenderness. Many women experience fibrocystic breast changes related to their menstrual cycles.</li>
    <li><strong>Fibroadenomas.</strong> Fibroadenomas are solid, noncancerous breast tumors that are smooth and move easily under your skin when touched. A fibroadenoma may grow larger if you're pregnant or using hormone therapy.</li>
    <li><strong>Injuries and infections.</strong> A severe injury to your breast tissue or nearby nerves can create a breast lump. Doctors describe this condition as fat necrosis. A collection of infected fluid (abscess) in breast tissue also can cause a breast lump, one that's often associated with localized breast pain.</li>
    <li><strong>Breast cancer.</strong> A breast lump that's painless, hard, irregularly shaped and different from surrounding breast tissue might be breast cancer. Skin covering the lump may look red, dimpled or pitted like the skin of an orange. Your breast size and shape may change, or you may notice discharge from the nipple.</li>
</ul>
<p>Only by seeing your doctor for evaluation can you be certain of what kinds of tests you might need and which type of breast lump you have.</p>

<p>Wheat allergy is an allergic reaction to foods containing wheat, one of the top eight food allergens in the United States. Allergic reactions can result from eating wheat, but also, in some cases, by inhaling wheat flour. Wheat can be found in many foods, including some you might not suspect, such as beer, soy sauce and ketchup.</p>
<p>Avoiding wheat is the primary treatment for wheat allergy. Medications may be necessary to manage allergic reactions if you accidentally eat wheat.</p>
<p>Wheat allergy sometimes is confused with celiac disease, but these conditions differ. A wheat allergy generates an allergy-causing antibody to proteins found in wheat. In people with celiac disease, a particular protein in wheat &mdash; gluten &mdash; causes an abnormal immune system reaction.</p>



CHRONIC-FATIGUE-SYNDROME
definition


<p>Chronic fatigue syndrome is a complicated disorder characterized by extreme fatigue that can't be explained by any underlying medical condition. The fatigue may worsen with physical or mental activity, but doesn't improve with rest.</p>
<p>The cause of chronic fatigue syndrome is unknown, although there are many theories &mdash; ranging from viral infections to psychological stress. Some experts believe chronic fatigue syndrome might be triggered by a combination of factors.</p>
<p>There's no single test to confirm a diagnosis of chronic fatigue syndrome. You may need a variety of medical tests to rule out other health problems that have similar symptoms. Treatment for chronic fatigue syndrome focuses on symptom relief.</p>



ENLARGED-HEART
definition


<p>An enlarged heart (cardiomegaly) isn't a disease, but rather a symptom of another condition.</p>
<p>The term "cardiomegaly" most commonly refers to an enlarged heart seen on a chest X-ray. Other tests are then needed to diagnose the condition causing your enlarged heart.</p>
<p>You may develop an enlarged heart temporarily because of a stress on your body, such as pregnancy, or because of a medical condition, such as the weakening of the heart muscle, coronary artery disease, heart valve problems or abnormal heart rhythms.</p>
<p>An enlarged heart may be treatable by correcting the cause. Treatment for an enlarged heart can include medications, medical procedures or surgery.</p>



ADRENAL-CANCER
definition


<p>Adrenal cancer is a rare cancer that develops in the small, triangular glands located on top of your kidneys (adrenal glands). Adrenal glands produce hormones that give instructions to virtually every organ and tissue in your body.</p>
<p>Adrenal cancer is often aggressive. When found early, adrenal cancer can be cured. But if the cancer has spread to areas beyond the adrenal gland, cure becomes less likely. Treatment can be used to delay progression or recurrence.</p>
<p>Noncancerous <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.org/benign-adrenal-tumors/">(benign) adrenal tumors</a>, such as adenomas or pheochromocytoma, also can develop in the adrenal glands.</p>

SMALL-VESSEL-DISEASE
definition


<p>Small vessel disease is a condition in which the small arteries in the heart become narrowed. Small vessel disease causes signs and symptoms of heart disease, such as chest pain (angina). </p>
<p>Small vessel disease is sometimes called coronary microvascular disease or small vessel heart disease. It's usually diagnosed after a doctor checks for blockages in the main arteries of the heart but finds little or no narrowing in the large vessels, even though your symptoms persist. </p>
<p>Although anyone can have small vessel disease, it's more common in women and in people who have diabetes or high blood pressure. Small vessel disease is treatable but can be difficult to detect. </p>

HYPONATREMIA
definition


<p>Hyponatremia is a condition that occurs when the level of sodium in your blood is abnormally low. Sodium is an electrolyte, and it helps regulate the amount of water that's in and around your cells.</p>
<p>In hyponatremia, one or more factors &mdash; ranging from an underlying medical condition to drinking too much water during endurance sports &mdash; causes the sodium in your body to become diluted. When this happens, your body's water levels rise, and your cells begin to swell. This swelling can cause many health problems, from mild to life-threatening.</p>
<p>Hyponatremia treatment is aimed at resolving the underlying condition. Depending on the cause of hyponatremia, you may simply need to cut back on how much you drink. In other cases of hyponatremia, you may need intravenous fluids and medications.</p>



POLIO
definition


<p>Polio is a contagious viral illness that in its most severe form causes paralysis, difficulty breathing and sometimes death.</p>
<p>In the U.S., the last case of naturally occurring polio happened in 1979. Today, despite a concerted global eradication campaign, poliovirus continues to affect children and adults in Afghanistan, Pakistan and some African countries.</p>
<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) advises taking precautions to protect against polio if you're traveling anywhere there's a risk of polio.</p>
<p>If you're a previously vaccinated adult who plans to travel to an area where polio is occurring, you should receive a booster dose of inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV). Immunity after a booster dose lasts a lifetime.</p>

CHILDHOOD-OBESITY
definition


<p>Childhood obesity is a serious medical condition that affects children and adolescents. It occurs when a child is well above the normal weight for his or her age and height.</p>
<p>Childhood obesity is particularly troubling because the extra pounds often start children on the path to health problems that were once confined to adults, such as diabetes, high blood pressure and high cholesterol. Childhood obesity can also lead to poor self-esteem and depression.</p>
<p>One of the best strategies to reduce childhood obesity is to improve the diet and exercise habits of your entire family. Treating and preventing childhood obesity helps protect the health of your child now and in the future.</p>



DRUG-ADDICTION
definition


<p>Drug addiction is a dependence on an illegal drug or a medication. When you're addicted, you may not be able to control your drug use and you may continue using the drug despite the harm it causes. Drug addiction can cause an intense craving for the drug. You may want to quit, but most people find they can't do it on their own. </p>
<p>For many people, what starts as casual use leads to drug addiction. Drug addiction can cause serious, long-term consequences, including problems with physical and mental health, relationships, employment and the law. </p>
<p>You may need help from your doctor, family, friends, support groups or an organized treatment program to overcome your drug addiction and stay drug-free. </p>



OSTEOMALACIA
definition


<p>Osteomalacia refers to a softening of your bones, often caused by a vitamin D deficiency. Soft bones are more likely to bow and fracture than are harder, healthy bones.</p>
<p>Osteomalacia is not the same as osteoporosis, another bone disorder that also can lead to bone fractures. Osteomalacia results from a defect in the bone-building process, while osteoporosis develops due to a weakening of previously constructed bone.</p>
<p>Muscle weakness and achy bone pain are the major symptoms of osteomalacia. Treatment for osteomalacia involves replenishing low levels of vitamin D and calcium and treating any underlying disorders that may be causing the deficiencies.</p>



CYSTOCELE
definition


<p>A cystocele (SIS-to-seel) occurs when the supportive tissue between a woman's bladder and vaginal wall weakens and stretches, allowing the bladder to bulge into the vagina. A cystocele is also called a prolapsed bladder. </p>
<p>Straining the muscles that support your pelvic organs may lead to a cystocele. Such straining occurs during vaginal childbirth or with chronic constipation, violent coughing or heavy lifting. Cystoceles also tend to cause problems after menopause, when estrogen levels decrease. </p>
<p>For a mild or moderate cystocele, nonsurgical treatment is often effective. In more severe cases, surgery may be necessary to keep the vagina and other pelvic organs in their proper positions. </p>



BIRD-FLU
definition


<p>Bird flu is caused by a type of influenza virus that rarely infects humans. But when bird flu does strike humans, it's often deadly. More than half the people who become infected with bird flu die of the disease. </p>
<p>In recent years, outbreaks of bird flu have occurred in Asia, Africa and parts of Europe. Most people who have developed symptoms of bird flu have had close contact with sick birds. In a few cases, bird flu has passed from one person to another. </p>
<p>Health officials worry that a global outbreak could occur if a bird flu virus mutates into a form that transmits more easily from person to person. Researchers are working on vaccines to help protect people from bird flu.</p>

MGUS
definition


<p>Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) is a condition in which an abnormal protein (monoclonal protein, or M protein) is in the blood. M protein is produced by plasma cells, a type of white blood cell. Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance usually causes no problems. Sometimes, monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance is either associated with another disease or can progress over years to other disorders, including some forms of blood cancer.</p>
<p>If you have monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance, you'll usually have periodic checkups to monitor your level of M protein. If there's no increase, monoclonal gammopathy doesn't require treatment.</p>
<p>With close monitoring, if monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance does progress, you'll get earlier treatment.</p>



ANGELMAN-SYNDROME
definition


<p>Angelman syndrome is a genetic disorder that causes developmental disabilities and neurological problems, such as difficulty speaking, balancing and walking and, in some cases, seizures. Frequent smiles and outbursts of laughter are common for people with Angelman syndrome, and many have happy, excitable personalities. </p>
<p>Angelman syndrome usually isn't detected until parents begin to notice developmental delays when a baby is about 6 to 12 months old. Seizures often begin when a child is between 2 and 3 years old. </p>
<p>People with Angelman syndrome tend to live a normal life span, but they may become less excitable with age. Other signs and symptoms remain. Treatment for Angelman syndrome focuses on managing the child's medical and developmental problems. </p>



MUMPS
definition


<p>Mumps is a viral infection that primarily affects the parotid glands &mdash; one of three pairs of saliva-producing (salivary) glands, situated below and in front of your ears. If you or your child contracts mumps, it can cause swelling in one or both parotid glands. </p>
<p>Mumps was common in the United States until mumps vaccination became routine. Since then, the number of cases has dropped dramatically, so your odds of getting mumps are low. Complications of mumps, such as hearing loss, are potentially serious, but rare. </p>
<p>There's no specific treatment for mumps. Mumps outbreaks still occur in the United States, and mumps is still common in many parts of the world, so getting a vaccination to prevent mumps remains important. </p>



CUTANEOUS-T-CELL-LYMPHOMA
definition


<p>Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma is a rare type of cancer that begins in the white blood cells and attacks the skin. Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma is one of several types of lymphoma collectively called non-Hodgkin lymphoma.</p>
<p>Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma can cause rash-like skin redness and, sometimes, skin tumors. Treatments can include skin creams, light therapy, medications and radiation therapy.</p>
<p>Several types of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma exist, including mycosis fungoides and Sezary syndrome.</p>

WHOOPING-COUGH
definition


<p>Whooping cough (pertussis) is a highly contagious respiratory tract infection. In many people, it's marked by a severe hacking cough followed by a high-pitched intake of breath that sounds like "whoop." </p>
<p>Before the vaccine was developed, whooping cough was considered a childhood disease. Now whooping cough primarily affects children too young to have completed the full course of vaccinations and teenagers and adults whose immunity has faded. </p>
<p>Deaths associated with whooping cough are rare but most commonly occur in infants. That's why it's so important for pregnant women &mdash; and other people who will have close contact with an infant &mdash; to be vaccinated against whooping cough. </p>



WET-MACULAR-DEGENERATION
definition


<p>Wet macular degeneration is a chronic eye disease that causes vision loss in the center of your field of vision. Wet macular degeneration is generally caused by abnormal blood vessels that leak fluid or blood into the region of the macula (MAK-u-luh). The macula is in the center of the retina (the layer of tissue on the inside back wall of your eyeball). </p>
<p>Wet macular degeneration is one of two types of age-related macular degeneration. The other type &mdash; dry macular degeneration &mdash; is more common and less severe. Wet macular degeneration almost always begins as dry macular degeneration. It's not clear what causes wet macular degeneration. </p>
<p>Early detection and treatment of wet macular degeneration may help reduce vision loss and, in some instances, improve vision. </p>

CAVERNOUS-MALFORMATIONS
definition


<p>Cavernous malformations are abnormally formed blood vessels that have the appearance of a small mulberry in the brain or spinal cord. These malformations may be hereditary or they may occur on their own.</p>
<p>These malformations may leak blood, leading to bleeding in the brain (hemorrhage). This can cause neurological symptoms, depending on the location of your cavernous malformation in your nervous system. Your symptoms may include weakness or numbness in the face, arm or leg, unsteadiness, vision loss or double vision, and difficulties speaking or swallowing. Seizures also can occur. Repeat hemorrhages may occur soon after your initial hemorrhage (within weeks) or later after your initial hemorrhage (many months or years later), or repeat hemorrhages may never occur.</p>



FEVER
definition


<p>A fever is a temporary increase in your body temperature, often due to an illness. Having a fever is a sign that something out of the ordinary is going on in your body.</p>
<p>For an adult, a fever may be uncomfortable, but usually isn't a cause for concern unless it reaches 103 F (39.4 C) or higher. For infants and toddlers, a slightly elevated temperature may indicate a serious infection.</p>
<p>Fevers generally go away within a few days. A number of over-the-counter medications lower a fever, but sometimes it's better left untreated. Fever seems to play a key role in helping your body fight off a number of infections.</p>



NAEGLERIA-INFECTION
definition


<p>Naegleria (nay-GLEER-e-uh) infection is a rare and usually fatal brain infection caused by an amoeba commonly found in freshwater lakes, rivers and hot springs. Exposure occurs during swimming or other water sports. </p>
<p>The amoeba &mdash; called Naegleria fowleri &mdash; travels up the nose to the brain, where it causes severe damage. Most people who have naegleria infection die within a week. </p>
<p>Millions of people are exposed to the amoeba that causes naegleria infection each year, but only a handful of them ever get sick from it. Health officials don't know why some people develop naegleria infection while others don't. </p>
<p>Avoiding warm bodies of fresh water and wearing nose clips while in the water may help prevent such infections. </p>



NONMELANOMA-SKIN-CANCER
definition


<p>Nonmelanoma skin cancer refers to all the types of cancer that occur in the skin that are not melanoma.</p>
<p>Several types of skin cancer fall within the broader category of nonmelanoma skin cancer, with the most common types being basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma.</p>
<p>Nonmelanoma skin cancer includes:</p>

    <li>Sebaceous gland carcinoma</li>
    <li>Cancer that spreads from other areas of the body to the skin, such as breast cancer and mouth cancer</li>
</ul>
<p>Nonmelanoma skin cancer treatment depends on the type of cancer. Skin cancer treatment usually involves surgery to remove the cancer cells.</p>



DIABETIC-HYPOGLYCEMIA
definition


<p>Low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) can affect people who have diabetes. It occurs when there's too much insulin and not enough sugar (glucose) in your blood. Hypoglycemia is defined as blood sugar below 70 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) or 4 millimoles per liter (mmol/L). Several factors can cause hypoglycemia in people with diabetes, including taking too much insulin or other diabetes medications, skipping a meal, or exercising harder than usual. </p>
<p>Pay attention to early warning signs, so you can treat low blood sugar promptly. Treatment involves short-term steps &mdash; such as taking glucose tablets &mdash; to raise your blood sugar into a normal range. </p>
<p>Left untreated, diabetic hypoglycemia can lead to seizures and loss of consciousness. This is considered a medical emergency. Tell family and friends what symptoms to look for and what to do in case you're not able to treat diabetic hypoglycemia yourself. </p>



MONONUCLEOSIS
definition


<p>Infectious mononucleosis (mono) is often called the kissing disease. The virus that causes mono is transmitted through saliva, so you can get it through kissing, but you can also be exposed through a cough or sneeze, or by sharing a glass or food utensils with someone who has mono. However, mononucleosis isn't as contagious as some infections, such as the common cold. </p>
<p>You're most likely to get mononucleosis with all the signs and symptoms if you're an adolescent or young adult. Young children usually have few symptoms, and the infection often goes unrecognized. </p>
<p>If you have mononucleosis, it's important to be careful of certain complications such as an enlarged spleen. Rest and adequate fluids are key to recovery. </p>



MENORRHAGIA
definition


<p>Menorrhagia is the medical term for menstrual periods with abnormally heavy or prolonged bleeding. Although heavy menstrual bleeding is a common concern among premenopausal women, most women don't experience blood loss severe enough to be defined as menorrhagia.</p>
<p>With menorrhagia, every period you have causes enough blood loss and cramping that you can't maintain your usual activities. If you have menstrual bleeding so heavy that you dread your period, talk with your doctor. There are many effective treatments for menorrhagia.</p>



PERIPHERAL-NERVE-INJURIES
definition


<p>Your peripheral nerves link your brain and spinal cord to the other parts of your body, such as your muscles and skin. Peripheral nerves are fragile and easily damaged. A nerve injury can interfere with your brain's ability to communicate with your muscles and organs.</p>
<p>If you feel tingling or numbness in your leg, arm, shoulder or hand, you may have injured one or more nerves when you had an accident or broke a bone. You may also experience numbness or tingling if a nerve is being compressed due to factors such as a narrow passageway, tumor or other diseases.</p>
<p>It's important to get medical care for a peripheral nerve injury as soon as possible because nerve tissue can be repaired. Early diagnosis and treatment can prevent complications and permanent injury.</p>

SOY-ALLERGY
definition


<p>Allergy to soy, a product of soybeans, is a common food allergy. Often, soy allergy starts in infancy with reaction to soy-based infant formula. Although most children outgrow soy allergy, some carry the allergy into adulthood.</p>
<p>Mild signs and symptoms of soy allergy include hives or itching in and around the mouth. In rare cases, soy allergy can cause a life-threatening allergic reaction (anaphylaxis).</p>
<p>If you or your child has a reaction to soy, let your doctor know. Tests can help confirm a soy allergy.</p>
<p>Having a soy allergy means avoiding products that contain soy, which can be difficult. Many foods, such as meat products, bakery goods, chocolate and breakfast cereals, may contain soy.</p>

<p>Diaper rash is a common form of inflamed skin (dermatitis) that appears as a patchwork of bright red skin on your baby's bottom. </p>
<p>Diaper rash is commonly linked to continuously wet or infrequently changed diapers, diarrhea, and using plastic pants to cover diapers. Diaper rash also may develop after solid foods are added to your baby's diet, when breast-feeding mothers eat certain foods or when your baby is taking antibiotics. </p>
<p>Diaper rash can alarm parents and annoy babies, but most diaper rash cases can be resolved with simple at-home treatments. </p>



OSTEOMYELITIS
definition


<p>Osteomyelitis is an infection in a bone. Infections can reach a bone by traveling through the bloodstream or spreading from nearby tissue. Osteomyelitis can also begin in the bone itself if an injury exposes the bone to germs. </p>
<p>In children, osteomyelitis most commonly affects the long bones of the legs and upper arm, while adults are more likely to develop osteomyelitis in the bones that make up the spine (vertebrae). People who have diabetes may develop osteomyelitis in their feet if they have foot ulcers. </p>
<p>Once considered an incurable condition, osteomyelitis can be successfully treated today. Most people require surgery to remove parts of the bone that have died &mdash; followed by strong antibiotics, often delivered intravenously, typically for at least six weeks. </p>

<p>Carcinoid syndrome occurs when a rare cancerous tumor called a carcinoid tumor secretes certain chemicals into your bloodstream, causing a variety of signs and symptoms. Carcinoid tumors occur most commonly in the gastrointestinal tract or lungs. </p>
<p>Carcinoid syndrome typically occurs in people who have carcinoid tumors that are advanced. Treatment for carcinoid syndrome usually involves treating the cancer. However, because most carcinoid tumors don't cause carcinoid syndrome until they're advanced, a cure may not be possible. In those cases, medications may relieve your symptoms of carcinoid syndrome and make you more comfortable. </p>

HIP-FRACTURE
definition


<p>A hip fracture is a serious injury, particularly if you're older, and complications can be life-threatening. Most hip fractures occur in people older than 65, with the risk increasing most rapidly after age 80. </p>
<p>Older people are at higher risk of hip fracture because bones tend to weaken with age. This bone weakening is called osteoporosis. Multiple medications, poor vision and balance problems also make older people more likely to trip and fall &mdash; one of the most common causes of hip fracture. </p>
<p>A hip fracture almost always requires surgical repair or replacement, followed by months of physical therapy. Taking steps to maintain bone density and prevent falls can help prevent hip fracture. </p>



POSTHERPETIC-NEURALGIA
definition


<p>Postherpetic neuralgia (post-her-PET-ic noo-RAL-jah) is a complication of shingles, which is caused by the chickenpox (herpes zoster) virus. Most cases of shingles clear up within a few weeks. But if the pain lasts long after the shingles rash and blisters have disappeared, it's called postherpetic neuralgia. </p>
<p>Postherpetic neuralgia affects your nerve fibers and skin, and the burning pain associated with postherpetic neuralgia can be severe enough to interfere with sleep and appetite. The risk of postherpetic neuralgia increases with age, primarily affecting people older than 60. The area affected also makes a difference. When shingles occurs on the face, for example, the likelihood of postherpetic neuralgia is significantly higher than for other parts of the body. </p>
<p>Currently, there's no cure for postherpetic neuralgia, but there are treatment options to ease symptoms. For most people, postherpetic neuralgia improves over time. </p>

CONVERGENCE-INSUFFICIENCY
definition


<p>Convergence insufficiency occurs when your eyes don't work together while you're trying to focus on a nearby object. When you read or look at a close object, your eyes need to turn inward together (converge) to focus. This gives you binocular vision, enabling you to see a single image.</p>
<p>Convergence insufficiency can cause difficulty with reading. This may make parents or teachers suspect that a child has a learning disability, instead of an eye disorder.</p>
<p>Treatments for convergence insufficiency are usually effective.</p>

RETINAL-DETACHMENT
definition


<p>Retinal detachment describes an emergency situation in which a critical layer of tissue (the retina) at the back of the eye pulls away from the layer of blood vessels that provides it with oxygen and nourishment. </p>
<p>Retinal detachment leaves the retinal cells lacking oxygen. The longer retinal detachment goes untreated, the greater your risk of permanent vision loss in the affected eye. </p>
<p>Fortunately, retinal detachment often has symptoms that are clear warning signs. Early diagnosis and treatment of retinal detachment can save your vision. If you suspect you may have a retinal detachment, contact an eye specialist (ophthalmologist) as soon as warning signs appear. </p>

PITYRIASIS-ROSEA
definition


<p>Pityriasis (pit-ih-RIE-uh-sis) rosea is a skin rash that usually begins as one large circular or oval spot on your chest, abdomen or back. Called a herald patch, this initial spot can be up to 4 inches (10 centimeters) across. </p>
<p>The herald patch is typically followed by a distinctive pattern of similar but smaller lesions that sweep out from the middle of your body in a shape that resembles drooping pine-tree branches. </p>
<p>Pityriasis rosea can affect any age group, but it most commonly occurs between the ages of 10 and 35. It usually goes away on its own within six weeks. Pityriasis rosea can cause itching, and treatment usually focuses on relieving symptoms. </p>

CHURG-STRAUSS-SYNDROME
definition


<p>Churg-Strauss syndrome &mdash; also known as eosinophilic granulomatosis (gran-u-loe-muh-TOE-sis) with polyangiitis (pol-e-an-jee-I-tis) &mdash; is a disorder marked by blood vessel inflammation. This inflammation can restrict blood flow to vital organs and tissues, sometimes permanently damaging them. </p>
<p>Asthma is the most common sign of Churg-Strauss syndrome, but Churg-Strauss syndrome can cause a variety of problems, ranging from hay fever, rash and gastrointestinal bleeding to severe pain and numbness in your hands and feet. The wide range of signs and symptoms and their similarity to those of other disorders makes Churg-Strauss syndrome challenging to diagnose. </p>
<p>Churg-Strauss syndrome is rare and has no cure. But, your doctor can usually help you control symptoms with steroids and other powerful immunosuppressant drugs. </p>

<p>Sarcoidosis is the growth of tiny collections of inflammatory cells in different parts of your body &mdash; most commonly the lungs, lymph nodes, eyes and skin. </p>
<p>Doctors believe sarcoidosis results from the body's immune system responding to an unknown substance, most likely something inhaled from the air. There is no cure for sarcoidosis, but most people do very well with modest treatment. Sarcoidosis often goes away on its own. Alternatively, signs and symptoms of sarcoidosis may last for years and sometimes lead to organ damage. </p>

SALMONELLA
definition


<p>Salmonella infection is a common bacterial disease that affects the intestinal tract. Salmonella bacteria typically live in animal and human intestines and are shed through feces. Humans become infected most frequently through contaminated water or food.</p>
<p>Typically, people with salmonella infection have no symptoms. Others develop diarrhea, fever and abdominal cramps within eight to 72 hours. Most healthy people recover within a few days without specific treatment.</p>
<p>In some cases, the diarrhea associated with salmonella infection can be so dehydrating as to require prompt medical attention. Life-threatening complications also may develop if the infection spreads beyond your intestines. Your risk of acquiring salmonella infection is higher if you travel to countries with poor sanitation.</p>

ATRIOVENTRICULAR-CANAL-DEFECT
definition


<p>Atrioventricular canal defect is a combination of several abnormalities in the heart present at birth (congenital abnormalities). This defect, which is sometimes called endocardial cushion defect or atrioventricular septal defect, occurs when there's a hole between the chambers of the heart and problems with the valves that regulate blood flow in the heart. </p>
<p>Atrioventricular canal defect allows extra blood to circulate to the lungs. Ensuing problems overwork the heart and cause it to enlarge. </p>
<p>Atrioventricular canal defect is often associated with Down syndrome. If left untreated, atrioventricular canal defect may cause heart failure and high blood pressure in the lungs. To fix this defect, doctors often recommend surgery during the first year of life to close the hole and reconstruct the valves. </p>

CREST-SYNDROME
definition


<p>Limited scleroderma, or CREST syndrome, is one subtype of scleroderma &mdash; a condition that literally means "hardened skin."</p>
<p>The skin changes associated with limited scleroderma typically occur only in the lower arms and legs and sometimes the face and throat. Limited scleroderma can also affect your digestive tract.</p>
<p>The problems caused by limited scleroderma may be minor. Sometimes, however, the disease affects the lungs or heart, with potentially serious results. Limited scleroderma has no known cure, and treatments focus on managing symptoms and preventing serious complications.</p>



VAGINAL-AGENESIS
definition


<p>Vaginal agenesis (a-JEN-uh-sis) is a condition that develops before birth, in which the muscular canal (vagina) to your uterus fails to develop fully. When this happens, other problems also may appear. For example, you may have a small uterus or, more commonly, no uterus at all.</p>
<p>For vaginal agenesis, your treatment team can include doctors specially trained to treat children and adolescents (pediatricians), female reproductive systems (gynecologists and urogynecologists) and intestinal problems (colorectal surgeons). Your treatment team works with you to find the most appropriate solution for your disorder.</p>
<p>After treatment, you may be able to have a normal sex life. Most women with the disorder can't get pregnant. If you have healthy ovaries, however, it may be possible to have a baby through in vitro fertilization using a surrogate mother.</p>



HYPOTHERMIA
definition


<p>Hypothermia is a medical emergency that occurs when your body loses heat faster than it can produce heat, causing a dangerously low body temperature. Normal body temperature is around 98.6 F (37 C). Hypothermia (hi-poe-THUR-me-uh) occurs as your body temperature passes below 95 F (35 C).</p>

<p>When your body temperature drops, your heart, nervous system and other organs can't work normally. Left untreated, hypothermia can eventually lead to complete failure of your heart and respiratory system and to death.</p>

<p>Hypothermia is most often caused by exposure to cold weather or immersion in a cold body of water. Primary treatments for hypothermia are methods to warm the body back to a normal temperature.</p>



MENSTRUAL-CRAMPS
definition


<p>Menstrual cramps (dysmenorrhea) are throbbing or cramping pains in the lower abdomen. Many women experience menstrual cramps just before and during their menstrual periods.</p>
<p>For some women, the discomfort is merely annoying. For others, menstrual cramps can be severe enough to interfere with everyday activities for a few days every month.</p>
<p>Menstrual cramps may be caused by identifiable problems, such as endometriosis or uterine fibroids. Treating any underlying cause is key to reducing the pain. Menstrual cramps that aren't caused by an underlying condition tend to lessen with age and often improve once a woman has given birth.</p>



RECTAL-PROLAPSE
definition


<p>Rectal prolapse occurs when part of the large intestine's lowest section (rectum) slips outside the muscular opening at the end of the digestive tract (anus). The prolapsed rectum can cause <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.org/fecal-incontinence/">fecal incontinence</a>. Surgery is usually needed to treat rectal prolapse.</p>



YEAST-INFECTION
definition


<p>A vaginal yeast infection is a type of vaginitis &mdash; inflammation of the vagina &mdash; characterized by vaginal irritation, intense itchiness and vaginal discharge. A vaginal yeast infection affects your vagina and the tissues at the opening to your vagina (vulva). </p>
<p>Vaginal yeast infection &mdash; also called vaginal candidiasis &mdash; is very common. As many as 3 out of 4 women experience a yeast infection at some point in their lifetimes. Many women experience two or more yeast infections. </p>
<p>A vaginal yeast infection isn't considered a sexually transmitted infection, although the fungus that causes the condition can be spread through oral-genital contact. Simple treatment is usually effective, unless you have recurrent yeast infections &mdash; four or more in a single year. In that case, you may need a longer course of therapy and a maintenance plan. </p>



PEDIATRIC-BRAIN-TUMORS
definition


<p>Pediatric brain tumors are masses or growths of abnormal cells that occur in the brain or the tissue and structures that are near it. Many different types of pediatric brain tumors exist. Some pediatric brain tumors are noncancerous (benign), and some pediatric brain tumors are cancerous (malignant).</p>
<p>Treatment and chance of recovery (prognosis) depend on the tumor type, its location within the brain, whether it has spread, and your child's age and general health. Because new treatments and technologies are continually being developed, several options may be available at different points in treatment. Pediatric brain tumor treatment is tailored to the individual needs of your child and your family.</p>



SYSTEMIC-CAPILLARY-LEAK-SYNDROME
definition


<p>Systemic capillary leak syndrome (SCLS), also called Clarkson's disease, is a rare disorder characterized by massive leakage of plasma from blood vessels into nearby body cavities and muscles. The leakage is caused by a sudden and unexplained change in the capillary walls that allows fluid to leak out. Unless treated, this results in a sharp drop in blood pressure that can lead to organ failure and death.</p>
<h3>About</h3>
<p>Early signs and symptoms of systemic capillary leak syndrome (SCLS) can be similar to those of a common cold, involving nasal congestion, runny nose or a cough. This may progress to lightheadedness, weakness, fatigue, nausea, and sudden swelling (edema) of the arms, legs and other parts of the body. Fluid may collect around the heart, lungs and muscles, causing a potentially dangerous situation. Fainting can occur due to a rapid drop in blood pressure from fluid leakage.</p>
<p>SCLS doesn't appear to be inherited. The causes are unknown, but one possibility includes the presence of a chemical that damages or temporarily separates the cells lining the capillary walls, making them leak fluid. Treatment may control the disorder for weeks or even years, but primary SCLS is unlikely to be completely cured. A long-term (chronic), less intense form of SCLS can cause frequent symptoms.</p>



PORPHYRIA
definition


<p>Porphyria (poor-FEAR-e-uh) refers to a group of disorders that result from a buildup of natural chemicals that produce porphyrin in your body. Porphyrins are essential for the function of hemoglobin &mdash; a protein in your red blood cells that links to porphyrin, binds iron, and carries oxygen to your organs and tissue. High levels of porphyrins can cause significant problems.</p>
<p>Porphyria mainly affects your nervous system, skin and other organs. The signs and symptoms of porphyria can vary, depending on the specific type and severity. Porphyria is usually inherited &mdash; one or both parents pass along an abnormal gene to their child. But in some types of porphyria, environmental factors may trigger the development of symptoms.</p>
<p>Treatment depends on the type of porphyria you have. Although porphyria usually can't be cured, certain lifestyle changes may help you manage it.</p>



SOLITARY-FIBROUS-TUMORS
definition


<p>Solitary fibrous tumors are rare growths of soft tissue cells that can form nearly anywhere in the body.</p>
<p>Solitary fibrous tumors most often occur in the lining around the outside of the lungs (pleural solitary fibrous tumors). Solitary fibrous tumors have also been found in the head and neck, breast, kidney, prostate, spinal cord, and other sites.</p>
<p>Most solitary fibrous tumors are noncancerous (benign), but in rare cases, solitary fibrous tumors can be cancerous (malignant).</p>
<p>Solitary fibrous tumors tend to grow slowly and may not cause signs and symptoms until they become very large.</p>

PERIMENOPAUSE
definition


<p>Perimenopause means "around menopause" and refers to the time period during which a woman's body makes its natural transition toward permanent infertility (menopause). Perimenopause is also called the menopausal transition. </p>
<p>Women start perimenopause at different ages. You may notice signs of progression toward menopause, such as menstrual irregularity, sometime in your 40s. But some women notice changes as early as their mid-30s. </p>
<p>The level of your estrogen &mdash; the main female hormone &mdash; rises and falls unevenly during perimenopause. Your menstrual cycles may lengthen or shorten, and you may begin having menstrual cycles in which your ovaries don't release an egg (ovulate). You may also experience menopause-like symptoms, such as hot flashes, sleep problems and vaginal dryness. Treatments are available to help ease these symptoms. </p>
<p>Once you've gone through 12 consecutive months without a menstrual period, you've officially reached menopause, and the perimenopause period is over. </p>



MULTIPLE-SYSTEM-ATROPHY
definition


<p>Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is a rare neurological disorder that impairs your body's involuntary (autonomic) functions, including blood pressure, heart rate, bladder function and digestion.</p>
<p>Formerly called Shy-Drager syndrome, the condition shares many Parkinson's disease-like symptoms, such as slowness of movement, muscle rigidity and poor balance.</p>
<p>Multiple system atrophy is a degenerative disease that develops in adulthood, usually in the 50s or 60s.</p>
<p>Treatment for MSA includes medications and lifestyle changes to help manage symptoms. The condition progresses gradually and eventually leads to death.</p>



ATELECTASIS
definition


<p>Atelectasis (at-uh-LEK-tuh-sis) &mdash; a complete or partial collapse of a lung or lobe of a lung &mdash; develops when the tiny air sacs (alveoli) within the lung become deflated. It is one of the most common breathing (respiratory) complications after surgery. Atelectasis is also a possible complication of other respiratory problems, including cystic fibrosis, inhaled foreign objects, lung tumors, fluid in the lung, severe asthma and chest injuries. </p>
<p>The amount of lung tissue involved in atelectasis is variable, depending on the cause. Signs and symptoms of atelectasis also vary. Atelectasis can be serious because it reduces the amount of oxygen available to your body. Treatment depends on the cause and severity of the collapse. </p>



MOLLUSCUM-CONTAGIOSUM
definition


<p>Molluscum contagiosum (mo-LUS-kum kun-tay-jee-OH-sum) is a relatively common viral infection of the skin that results in round, firm, painless bumps ranging in size from a pinhead to a pencil eraser. If the bumps are scratched or injured, the infection can spread to surrounding skin. </p>
<p>Though most common in children, molluscum contagiosum can affect adults as well &mdash; particularly those with weakened immune systems. In adults, molluscum contagiosum involving the genitals is considered a sexually transmitted infection (STI). </p>
<p>Molluscum contagiosum spreads through direct person-to-person contact and through contact with contaminated objects. The bumps associated with molluscum contagiosum usually disappear within a year without treatment but doctor-assisted removal is also an option.</p>



GALACTORRHEA
definition


<p>Galactorrhea (guh-lack-toe-REE-uh) is a milky nipple discharge unrelated to the normal milk production of breast-feeding. Galactorrhea itself isn't a disease, but it could be a sign of an underlying problem. It usually occurs in women, even those who have never had children or after menopause. But galactorrhea can happen in men and even in infants. </p>
<p>Excessive breast stimulation, medication side effects or disorders of the pituitary gland all may contribute to galactorrhea. Often, galactorrhea results from increased levels of prolactin, the hormone that stimulates milk production. </p>
<p>Sometimes, the cause of galactorrhea can't be determined. The condition may resolve on its own. </p>

DWARFISM
definition


<p>Dwarfism is short stature that results from a genetic or medical condition. Dwarfism is generally defined as an adult height of 4 feet 10 inches or less (147 centimeters). The average adult height among people with dwarfism is 4 feet (122 cm). </p>
<p>Treatments for most dwarfism-related conditions don't increase stature but may lessen complications. </p>
<p>People with dwarfism may encounter discrimination. Family support, social networks, advocacy groups and adaptive products enable most people with dwarfism to address challenges in educational, work and social settings. </p>



SPINAL-HEADACHES
definition


<p>Spinal headaches occur in up to 40 percent of those who undergo a spinal tap (lumbar puncture) or spinal anesthesia. Both procedures require a puncture of the tough membrane that surrounds the spinal cord and, in the lower spine, the lumbar and sacral nerve roots. </p>
<p>During a spinal tap, a sample of cerebrospinal fluid is withdrawn from your spinal canal. During spinal anesthesia, medication is injected into your spinal canal to numb the nerves in the lower half of your body. If spinal fluid leaks through the tiny puncture site, you may develop a spinal headache. </p>
<p>Most spinal headaches &mdash; also known as post-lumbar puncture headaches &mdash; resolve on their own with no treatment. However, spinal headaches lasting 24 hours or more may need treatment. </p>

NEURODERMATITIS
definition


<p>Neurodermatitis starts with a patch of itchy skin, but scratching it makes the area even itchier. Eventually you may scratch simply out of habit. This cycle of chronic itching and scratching can cause the affected skin to become thick and leathery. </p>
<p>Neurodermatitis &mdash; also known as lichen simplex chronicus &mdash; isn't serious, but breaking the itch-scratch cycle is challenging. </p>
<p>Successful treatment of neurodermatitis depends on identifying and eliminating factors that may be aggravating the problem. Over-the-counter and prescription creams can help ease neurodermatitis symptoms.</p>



SICK-SINUS-SYNDROME
definition


<p>Sick sinus syndrome &mdash; also known as sinus node disease or sinus node dysfunction &mdash; is the name for a group of heart rhythm problems (arrhythmias) in which the sinus node &mdash; the heart's natural pacemaker &mdash; doesn't work properly.</p>
<p>The sinus node is an area of specialized cells in the upper right chamber of the heart that controls the rhythm of your heart. Normally, the sinus node produces a steady pace of regular electrical impulses. In sick sinus syndrome, these signals are abnormally paced.</p>
<p>A person with sick sinus syndrome may have heart rhythms that are too fast, too slow, punctuated by long pauses &mdash; or an alternating combination of all of these rhythm problems. Sick sinus syndrome is relatively uncommon, but the risk of developing sick sinus syndrome increases with age.</p>
<p>Many people with sick sinus syndrome eventually need a pacemaker to keep the heart in a regular rhythm.</p>



ACHILLES-TENDINITIS
definition


<p>Achilles tendinitis is an overuse injury of the Achilles (uh-KIL-eez) tendon, the band of tissue that connects calf muscles at the back of the lower leg to your heel bone. </p>
<p>Achilles tendinitis most commonly occurs in runners who have suddenly increased the intensity or duration of their runs. It's also common in middle-aged people who play sports, such as tennis or basketball, only on the weekends. </p>
<p>Most cases of Achilles tendinitis can be treated with relatively simple, at-home care under your doctor's supervision. Self-care strategies are usually necessary to prevent recurring episodes. More-serious cases of Achilles tendinitis can lead to tendon tears (ruptures) that may require surgical repair. </p>

definition


<p>When you have a blocked tear duct, your tears can't drain normally, leaving you with a watery, irritated eye. Blocked tear ducts are caused by a partial or complete obstruction in the tear drainage system. </p>
<p>Blocked tear ducts are common in newborns, but they usually get better without any treatment during the first year of life. In adults, a blocked tear duct may be due to an injury, infection or a tumor. </p>
<p>A blocked tear duct almost always is correctable. Treatment depends on the cause of the blockage and your age. </p>

STUTTERING
definition


<p>Stuttering &mdash; also called stammering or childhood-onset fluency disorder &mdash; is a speech disorder that involves frequent and significant problems with the normal fluency and flow of speech. People who stutter know what they want to say, but have difficulty saying it. For example, they may repeat or prolong a word, syllable or phrase, or stop during speech and make no sound for certain syllables.</p>
<p>Stuttering is common among young children as a normal part of learning to speak. Young children may stutter when their speech and language abilities aren't developed enough to keep up with what they want to say. Most children outgrow this developmental stuttering.</p>
<p>Sometimes, however, stuttering is a chronic condition that persists into adulthood. This type of stuttering can have an impact on self-esteem and interactions with other people.</p>
<p>If you're an adult who stutters, seek help if stuttering causes you stress or anxiety or affects your self-esteem, career or relationships. See your doctor or a speech-language pathologist, or search for a program designed to treat adult stuttering.</p>
<p>Children and adults who stutter may benefit from treatments such as speech therapy, psychological counseling or using electronic devices to improve speech patterns. After a comprehensive evaluation by a speech-language pathologist, a decision about the best treatment approach can be made.</p>



CHRONIC-DAILY-HEADACHES

APHASIA
definition


<p>Aphasia is a condition that robs you of the ability to communicate. Aphasia can affect your ability to express and understand language, both verbal and written. </p>
<p>Aphasia typically occurs suddenly after a stroke or a head injury. But it can also come on gradually from a slowly growing brain tumor or a degenerative disease. The amount of disability depends on the location and the severity of the brain damage. </p>
<p>Once the underlying cause has been treated, the primary treatment for aphasia is speech therapy that focuses on relearning and practicing language skills and using alternative or supplementary communication methods. Family members often participate in the therapy process and function as communication partners of the person with aphasia. </p>



FETAL-MACROSOMIA
definition


<p>Fetal macrosomia is a term used to describe a newborn who's significantly larger than average. </p>
<p>A baby diagnosed with fetal macrosomia has a birth weight of more than 8 pounds, 13 ounces (4,000 grams), regardless of his or her gestational age. About 9 percent of babies born worldwide weigh more than 8 pounds, 13 ounces. However, the risks associated with fetal macrosomia increase greatly when birth weight is more than 9 pounds 15 ounces (4500 grams). </p>
<p>Fetal macrosomia makes vaginal delivery difficult and puts the baby at risk of injury during birth. Fetal macrosomia also puts the baby at increased risk of health problems after birth. </p>



FLOOR-MOUTH-CANCER
definition


<p>Floor of the mouth cancer affects the bottom of your mouth under your tongue. The most common type of floor of the mouth cancer is squamous cell, affecting the cells that line the mouth and throat (oral cavity). Changes in the look and feel of the soft tissue on the floor of your mouth, such as a lump or a sore that doesn't heal, may indicate cancer. Tobacco and heavy alcohol use increase your risk of floor of the mouth cancer.</p>



MICROCEPHALY
definition


<p>Microcephaly (my-kroh-SEF-uh-lee) is a rare neurological condition in which an infant's head is significantly smaller than the heads of other children of the same age and sex. Sometimes detected at birth, microcephaly usually is the result of the brain developing abnormally in the womb or not growing as it should after birth. </p>
<p>Microcephaly can be caused by a variety of genetic and environmental factors. Children with microcephaly often have developmental issues. Generally there's no treatment for microcephaly, but early intervention may help enhance your child's development and improve quality of life. </p>



LISTERIA-INFECTION
definition


<p>Listeria infection is a foodborne bacterial illness that can be very serious for pregnant women and people with impaired immune systems. Listeria infection is most commonly contracted by eating improperly processed deli meats and unpasteurized milk products.</p>
<p>Healthy people rarely become ill from listeria infection, but the disease can be fatal to unborn babies and newborns. People who have weakened immune systems also are at higher risk of life-threatening complications. Prompt antibiotic treatment can help curb the effects of listeria infection.</p>
<p>Listeria bacteria can survive refrigeration and even freezing. That's why people who are at higher risk of serious infections should avoid eating the types of food most likely to contain listeria bacteria.</p>

NEUROMYELITIS-OPTICA
definition


<p>Neuromyelitis optica (NMO), also called Devic's disease, is a central nervous system disorder causing primarily swelling and inflammation of the eye nerves (optic neuritis) and the spinal cord (myelitis).</p>
<p>Neuromyelitis optica occurs when your body's immune system reacts against its own cells in the central nervous system, mainly in the optic nerves and spinal cord, but sometimes in the brain. The cause often is unknown, although it may sometimes appear after an infection, or it may be associated with another autoimmune condition.</p>
<p>Neuromyelitis optica may cause blindness in one or both eyes, weakness or paralysis in the legs or arms, painful spasms, loss of sensation, and bladder or bowel dysfunction from spinal cord damage. NMO attacks may be reversible, but can be severe enough to cause permanent visual loss and problems with walking.</p>
<p>A small number of people with NMO experience vomiting before the onset of eye and spinal cord problems. Children may develop confusion, seizures or coma as a manifestation of NMO.</p>



LOW-SEX-DRIVE-IN-WOMEN
definition


<p>A woman's sexual desires naturally fluctuate over the years. Highs and lows commonly coincide with the beginning or end of a relationship or with major life changes, such as pregnancy, menopause or illness. Some antidepressants and anti-seizure medications also can cause low sex drive in women. </p>
<p>If you have a persistent or recurrent lack of interest in sex that causes you personal distress, you may have hypoactive sexual desire disorder. </p>
<p>But you don't have to meet this medical definition to seek help. If you are bothered by a low sex drive or decreased sex drive, there are lifestyle changes and sex techniques that may put you in the mood more often. Some medications may offer promise as well. </p>



GALLSTONES
definition


<p>Gallstones are hardened deposits of digestive fluid that can form in your gallbladder. Your gallbladder is a small, pear-shaped organ on the right side of your abdomen, just beneath your liver. The gallbladder holds a digestive fluid called bile that's released into your small intestine. </p>
<p>Gallstones range in size from as small as a grain of sand to as large as a golf ball. Some people develop just one gallstone, while others develop many gallstones at the same time. </p>
<p>Gallstones are common in the United States. People who experience symptoms from their gallstones usually require gallbladder removal surgery. Gallstones that don't cause any signs and symptoms typically don't need treatment. </p>

MILD-COGNITIVE-IMPAIRMENT
definition


<p>Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is an intermediate stage between the expected cognitive decline of normal aging and the more serious decline of dementia. It can involve problems with memory, language, thinking and judgment that are greater than normal age-related changes. If you have mild cognitive impairment, you may be aware that your memory or mental function has "slipped." Your family and close friends also may notice a change. But generally these changes aren't severe enough to interfere with your day-to-day life and usual activities.</p>
<p>Mild cognitive impairment may increase your risk of later progressing to dementia, caused by Alzheimer's disease or other neurological conditions. But some people with mild cognitive impairment never get worse, and a few eventually get better.</p>



BEHCETS-DISEASE
definition


<p>Behcet's (beh-CHETS) disease, also called Behcet's syndrome, is a rare disorder that causes inflammation in blood vessels throughout your body. The inflammation of Behcet's disease leads to numerous symptoms that may initially seem unrelated. The signs and symptoms of Behcet's disease &mdash; which may include mouth sores, eye inflammation, skin rashes and lesions, and genital sores &mdash; vary from person to person and may come and go on their own. </p>
<p>The exact cause of Behcet's is unknown, but it may be an autoimmune disorder, which means the body's immune system mistakenly attacks some of its own healthy cells. Both genetic and environmental factors may be responsible for Behcet's disease. </p>
<p>Treatment aims to reduce the signs and symptoms of Behcet's disease and to prevent serious complications, such as blindness. </p>



DRY-SOCKET
definition


<p>Dry socket (alveolar osteitis) is a painful dental condition that can occur after you have a permanent adult tooth extracted. Dry socket is the most common complication following tooth extractions, such as the removal of impacted wisdom teeth. If you develop dry socket, the pain usually begins three to four days after your tooth is removed. </p>
<p>Normally, a blood clot forms at the site of a tooth extraction. This blood clot serves as a protective layer over the underlying bone and nerve endings in the empty tooth socket. The clot also provides the foundation for the growth of new bone and for the development of soft tissue over the clot. </p>
<p>Dry socket occurs when the blood clot at the site of the tooth extraction has been dislodged or has dissolved before the wound has healed. Exposure of the underlying bone and nerves results in intense pain, not only in the socket but also along the nerves radiating to the side of your face. </p>
<p>Over-the-counter medications alone won't be enough to treat dry socket pain. Your dentist or oral surgeon can provide treatments to relieve your pain and promote healing. </p>

TURNER-SYNDROME
definition


<p>Turner syndrome, a condition that affects only girls and women, results when a sex chromosome (the X chromosome) is missing or partially missing. Turner syndrome can cause a variety of medical and developmental problems, including short height, failure to start puberty, infertility, heart defects, certain learning disabilities and social adjustment problems.</p>
<p>Turner syndrome may be diagnosed before birth (prenatal), during infancy or in early childhood. Occasionally the diagnosis is delayed until the teen or young adult years in those who have mild signs and symptoms of Turner syndrome.</p>
<p>Nearly all girls and women with Turner syndrome need ongoing medical care from a variety of specialists. Regular checkups and appropriate care can help most girls and women lead relatively healthy, independent lives.</p>



TONGUE-CANCER
definition


<p>Tongue cancer is a common and serious type of mouth cancer (oral cancer). Tongue cancer usually begins in the squamous cells that cover the surface of the tongue. When cancer forms in the front two-thirds of the tongue, it's classified as a type of oral cancer. Cancer that develops in the back third of the tongue is considered a form of throat (oropharyngeal) cancer.</p>
<p>When identified early, tongue cancer is highly curable. Oral cancers are about twice as common in men as in women. Tobacco, heavy alcohol use and exposure to <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/hpv-infection/DS00906">human papillomavirus (HPV)</a> increase the risk of oral cancers.</p>



CHRONIC-SINUSITIS
definition


<p>Chronic sinusitis is a common condition in which the cavities around nasal passages (sinuses) become inflamed and swollen &mdash; for at least eight weeks, despite treatment attempts. </p>
<p>Also known as chronic rhinosinusitis, this condition interferes with drainage and causes mucus to build up. If you have chronic sinusitis, it may be difficult to breathe through your nose. The area around your eyes and face may feel swollen, and you may have throbbing facial pain or a headache. </p>
<p>Chronic sinusitis may be caused by an infection, but it can also be caused by growths in the sinuses (nasal polyps) or by a deviated nasal septum. Chronic sinusitis most commonly affects young and middle-aged adults, but it also can affect children. </p>



LAZY-EYE
definition


<p>Lazy eye (amblyopia) is decreased vision that results from abnormal visual development in infancy and early childhood. Although lazy eye usually affects only one eye, it can affect both eyes. Lazy eye is the leading cause of decreased vision among children. Left untreated, vision loss may range from mild to severe. </p>
<p>With lazy eye, there may not be an obvious abnormality of the eye. Lazy eye develops when nerve pathways between the brain and the eye aren't properly stimulated. As a result, the brain favors one eye, usually due to poor vision in the other eye. The weaker eye tends to wander. Eventually, the brain may ignore the signals received from the weaker &mdash; or lazy &mdash; eye. </p>
<p>Usually doctors can correct lazy eye with eye patches, eyedrops, and glasses or contact lenses. Sometimes lazy eye requires surgical treatment. </p>



ALBINISM
definition


<p>Albinism includes a group of inherited disorders that are characterized by little or no production of the pigment melanin. The type and amount of melanin your body produces determines the color of your skin, hair and eyes. Most people with albinism are sensitive to sun exposure and are at increased risk of developing skin cancer.</p>
<p>Although there's no cure for albinism, people with the disorder can take steps to protect their skin and maximize their vision. Some people with albinism may feel socially isolated or experience discrimination.</p>

<p>Chronic constipation is infrequent bowel movements or difficult passage of stools that persists for several weeks or longer.</p>
<p>Constipation is generally described as having fewer than three bowel movements a week.</p>
<p>Though occasional constipation is very common, some people experience chronic constipation that can interfere with their ability to go about their daily tasks. Chronic constipation may also cause excessive straining to have a bowel movement and other signs and symptoms.</p>
<p>Treatment for chronic constipation depends on the underlying cause. Though, in some cases, a cause for chronic constipation is never found.</p>



BENIGN-ADRENAL-TUMORS
definition


<p>Benign adrenal tumors are noncancerous masses that form in the adrenal glands. Adrenal glands are located just above your kidneys. As part of your endocrine system, they produce hormones that give instructions to virtually every organ and tissue in your body. Benign adrenal tumors are also called adrenal adenomas.</p>
<p>Most benign adrenal tumors cause no symptoms and don't require treatment. But sometimes benign adrenal tumors can secrete high levels of certain hormones that can cause complications. In these cases, treatment for benign adrenal tumors may include surgery or medications.</p>

MOYAMOYA-DISEASE
definition


<p>Moyamoya disease is a rare blood vessel (vascular) disorder in which a ring of blood vessels at the base of your brain (the circle of Willis) and the uppermost (distal) segments of the arteries supplying the brain progressively narrow, causing blood flow to your brain to become reduced.</p>
<p>The condition may cause a ministroke (transient ischemic attack), <a href="/diseases-conditions/stroke/basics/definition/con-20042884">stroke</a> or other symptoms.</p>
<p>Moyamoya disease mainly affects children, but adults may have the condition. Moyamoya disease usually occurs in people from Japan and other Asian countries, but people in North America, Europe and other areas also have moyamoya disease.</p>

WHIPLASH
definition


<p>Whiplash is a neck injury that can occur during rear-end automobile collisions, when your head suddenly moves backward and then forward &mdash; similar to the motion of someone cracking a whip. These extreme motions push your neck muscles and ligaments beyond their normal range of motion. </p>
<p>Whiplash injuries can be mild or severe. Treatment typically begins with over-the-counter pain relievers and ice applied to the painful neck muscles. If pain persists, prescription medications and physical therapy may be helpful. </p>
<p>Most people recover from whiplash in just a few weeks, but some people may develop chronic pain after a whiplash injury. </p>



PREMATURE-BIRTH
definition


<p>A premature birth is a birth that takes place more than three weeks before the baby is due &mdash; in other words, after less than 37 weeks of pregnancy, which usually lasts about 40 weeks. </p>
<p>Premature birth gives the baby less time to develop in the womb. Premature babies, especially those born earliest, often have complicated medical problems. </p>
<p>Depending on how early a baby is born, he or she may be: </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Late preterm</strong>, born between 34 and 37 weeks of pregnancy</li>
    <li><strong>Very preterm</strong>, born at less than 32 weeks of pregnancy</li>
    <li><strong>Extremely preterm</strong>, born at less than 25 weeks of pregnancy</li>
</ul>
<p>Most premature births occur in the late preterm stage. </p>



OSGOOD-SCHLATTER-DISEASE
definition


<p>Osgood-Schlatter disease can cause a painful lump below the kneecap in children and adolescents experiencing growth spurts during puberty.</p>
<p>Osgood-Schlatter disease occurs most often in children who participate in sports that involve running, jumping and swift changes of direction &mdash; such as soccer, basketball, figure skating and ballet.</p>
<p>While Osgood-Schlatter disease is more common in boys, the gender gap is narrowing as more girls become involved with sports.</p>
<p>Age ranges differ by sex because girls experience puberty earlier than do boys. Osgood-Schlatter disease typically occurs in boys ages 13 to 14 and girls ages 11 to 12. The condition usually resolves on its own, once the child's bones stop growing.</p>



PRESCRIPTION-DRUG-ABUSE
definition


<p>Prescription drug abuse is the use of a prescription medication in a way not intended by the prescribing doctor, such as for the feelings you get from the drug. Prescription drug abuse or problematic use includes everything from taking a friend's prescription painkiller for your backache to snorting or injecting ground-up pills to get high. Drug abuse may become ongoing and compulsive, despite the negative consequences. </p>
<p>An increasing problem, prescription drug abuse can affect all age groups, but it's more common in young people. The prescription drugs most often abused include painkillers, sedatives, anti-anxiety medications and stimulants. </p>
<p>Early identification of prescription drug abuse and early intervention may prevent the problem from turning into an addiction. </p>



RHEUMATIC-FEVER
definition


<p>Rheumatic fever is an inflammatory disease that can develop as a complication of inadequately treated strep throat or scarlet fever. Strep throat and scarlet fever are caused by an infection with group A streptococcus bacteria.</p>
<p>Rheumatic fever is most common in 5- to 15-year-old children, though it can develop in younger children and adults. Although strep throat is common, rheumatic fever is rare in the United States and other developed countries. However, rheumatic fever remains common in many developing nations.</p>
<p>Rheumatic fever can cause permanent damage to the heart, including damaged heart valves and heart failure. Treatments can reduce tissue damage from inflammation, lessen pain and other symptoms, and prevent the recurrence of rheumatic fever.</p>



WALDENSTROM-MACROGLOBULINEMIA
definition


<p>Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia (mak-ro-glob-u-lih-NEE-me-uh), also called WM or lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma, is a type of <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.org/non-hodgkins-lymphoma/">non-Hodgkin's lymphoma</a> (also called non-Hodgkin lymphoma). WM is a rare, slow-growing cancer that begins in the immune system. Abnormal white blood cells (lymphocytes) in the bone marrow make an abnormal protein called monoclonal immunoglobulin M (IgM) that thickens the blood plasma. This causes the symptoms of WM.</p>
<p>The most common signs and symptoms include fatigue, nosebleeds, dizziness, gum bleeding, weight loss, bruising, headache, and numbness or tingling in your hands or feet. Your doctor may also find enlarged lymph glands in your neck, groin or under your arms.</p>



AGORAPHOBIA
definition


<p>Agoraphobia (ag-uh-ruh-FOE-be-uh) is a type of anxiety disorder in which you fear and often avoid places or situations that might cause you to panic and make you feel trapped, helpless or embarrassed.</p>
<p>With agoraphobia, you fear an actual or anticipated situation, such as using public transportation, being in open or enclosed spaces, standing in line or being in a crowd. The anxiety is caused by fear that there's no easy way to escape or seek help if intense anxiety develops. Most people who have agoraphobia develop it after having one or more panic attacks, causing them to fear another attack and avoid the place where it occurred.</p>
<p>People with agoraphobia often have a hard time feeling safe in any public place, especially where crowds gather. You may feel that you need a companion, such as a relative or friend, to go with you to public places. The fears can be so overwhelming that you may feel unable to leave your home.</p>
<p>Agoraphobia treatment can be challenging because it usually means confronting your fears. But with talk therapy (psychotherapy) and medications, you can escape the trap of agoraphobia and live a more enjoyable life.</p>



PANIC-ATTACKS
definition


<p>A panic attack is a sudden episode of intense fear that triggers severe physical reactions when there is no real danger or apparent cause. Panic attacks can be very frightening. When panic attacks occur, you might think you're losing control, having a heart attack or even dying. </p>
<p>Many people have just one or two panic attacks in their lifetimes, and the problem goes away, perhaps when a stressful situation ends. But if you've had recurrent, unexpected panic attacks and spent long periods in constant fear of another attack, you may have a condition called panic disorder. </p>
<p>Panic attacks were once dismissed as nerves or stress, but they're now recognized as a real medical condition. Although panic attacks can significantly affect your quality of life, treatment can be very effective. </p>



VERTIGO
definition


<p>Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is one of the most common causes of vertigo &mdash; the sudden sensation that you're spinning or that the inside of your head is spinning. </p>
<p>Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo is characterized by brief episodes of mild to intense dizziness. Symptoms of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo are triggered by specific changes in the position of your head, such as tipping your head up or down, and by lying down, turning over or sitting up in bed. You may also feel out of balance when standing or walking. </p>
<p>Although benign paroxysmal positional vertigo can be a bothersome problem, it's rarely serious except when it increases the chance of falls. You can receive effective treatment for benign paroxysmal positional vertigo during a doctor's office visit. </p>



DERMATOMYOSITIS
definition


<p>Dermatomyositis (dur-muh-toe-my-uh-SY-tis) is an uncommon inflammatory disease marked by muscle weakness and a distinctive skin rash.</p>
<p>Dermatomyositis affects adults and children alike. In adults, dermatomyositis usually occurs from the late 40s to early 60s. In children, the disease most often appears between 5 and 15 years of age. Dermatomyositis affects more females than males.</p>
<p>There's no cure for dermatomyositis, but periods of remission &mdash; when symptoms improve spontaneously &mdash; may occur. Treatment can clear the skin rash and help you regain muscle strength and function.</p>



FOOD-POISONING
definition


<p>Food poisoning, also called foodborne illness, is illness caused by eating contaminated food. Infectious organisms &mdash; including bacteria, viruses and parasites &mdash; or their toxins are the most common causes of food poisoning.</p>
<p>Infectious organisms or their toxins can contaminate food at any point of processing or production. Contamination can also occur at home if food is incorrectly handled or cooked.</p>
<p>Food poisoning symptoms, which can start within hours of eating contaminated food, often include nausea, vomiting or diarrhea. Most often, food poisoning is mild and resolves without treatment. But some people need to go to the hospital.</p>

DEVIATED-SEPTUM
definition


<p>A deviated septum occurs when the thin wall (nasal septum) between your nostrils is displaced to one side. In many people, the nasal septum is displaced &mdash; or deviated &mdash; making one nasal passage smaller. </p>
<p>When a deviated septum is severe, it can block one side of your nose and reduce airflow, causing difficulty breathing. The additional exposure of a deviated septum to the drying effect of airflow through the nose may sometimes contribute to crusting or bleeding in certain individuals. </p>
<p>Nasal obstruction can occur from a deviated nasal septum, from swelling of the tissues lining the nose, or from both. Treatment of nasal obstruction may include medications to reduce the swelling or adhesive strips that may help open the nasal passages. To correct a deviated septum, surgery is necessary. </p>

TYPE-1-DIABETES
definition


<p>Type 1 diabetes, once known as juvenile diabetes or insulin-dependent diabetes, is a chronic condition in which the pancreas produces little or no insulin, a hormone needed to allow sugar (glucose) to enter cells to produce energy. The far more common type 2 diabetes occurs when the body becomes resistant to insulin or doesn't make enough insulin.</p>
<p>Various factors may contribute to type 1 diabetes, including genetics and exposure to certain viruses. Although type 1 diabetes usually appears during childhood or adolescence, it also can begin in adults.</p>
<p>Despite active research, type 1 diabetes has no cure. But it can be managed. With proper treatment, people with type 1 diabetes can expect to live longer, healthier lives than did people with type 1 diabetes in the past.</p>

<p>Compulsive gambling, also called gambling disorder, is the uncontrollable urge to keep gambling despite the toll it takes on your life. Gambling means that you're willing to risk something you value in the hope of getting something of even greater value.</p>
<p>Gambling can stimulate the brain's reward system much like drugs such as alcohol can, leading to addiction. If you're prone to compulsive gambling, you may continually chase bets, hide your behavior, deplete savings, accumulate debt, or even resort to theft or fraud to support your addiction.</p>
<p>Compulsive gambling is a serious condition that can destroy lives. Although treating compulsive gambling can be challenging, many compulsive gamblers have found help through professional treatment.</p>



AORTIC-VALVE-DISEASE
definition


<p>Aortic valve disease is a condition in which the valve between the main pumping chamber of your heart (left ventricle) and the main artery to your body (aorta) doesn't work properly. Aortic valve disease sometimes may be a condition present at birth (congenital heart disease), or it may result from other causes.</p>
<p>Types of aortic valve disease include:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong><a href="/diseases-conditions/aortic-stenosis/basics/definition/con-20026329">Aortic valve stenosis</a>.</strong> In this condition, the aortic valve opening is narrowed. This narrowing prevents the valve from opening fully, which obstructs blood flow from your heart into your aorta and the rest of your body. </li>
    <li><strong><a href="/diseases-conditions/aortic-valve-regurgitation/basics/definition/con-20022523">Aortic valve regurgitation</a>.</strong> In this condition, the aortic valve doesn't close properly, causing blood to flow backward into the left ventricle. </li>

<p>Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) is an inherited (genetic) immune system disorder that occurs when a type of white blood cell (phagocyte) that usually helps your body fight infections doesn't work properly. As a result, the phagocytes can't protect your body from bacterial and fungal infections.</p>
<p>People with chronic granulomatous disease often may develop pneumonia, lung infections, skin infections, lymph node infections, liver infections, gastrointestinal inflammation or other infections. They may develop clusters of white blood cells (masses) in infected areas (granulomas). Most people are diagnosed with CGD during childhood, but some people may not be diagnosed until adulthood.</p>

<p>Pseudogout (SOO-doe-gout) is a form of arthritis characterized by sudden, painful swelling in one or more of your joints. These episodes can last for days or weeks. The most commonly affected joint is the knee. </p>
<p>Also called calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease, the common term "pseudogout" was coined for the condition's similarity to gout. Both conditions are caused by crystal deposits within a joint, although the type of crystal differs for each condition. </p>
<p>It isn't clear why crystals form in your joints and cause pseudogout, but the risk increases with age. Treatments can help relieve pain and reduce inflammation. </p>

PHENYLKETONURIA
definition


<p>Phenylketonuria (fen-ul-ke-toe-NU-re-uh) is a birth defect that causes an amino acid called phenylalanine to build up in your body. Phenylketonuria is caused by a mutation in a gene that helps create the enzyme needed to break down phenylalanine. </p>
<p>Amino acids are the building blocks for protein, but too much phenylalanine can cause a variety of health problems. People with phenylketonuria (PKU) &mdash; babies, children and adults &mdash; need to follow a diet that limits phenylalanine, which is found mostly in foods that contain protein. </p>
<p>Babies in the United States and many other countries are screened for phenylketonuria soon after birth. Although phenylketonuria is rare, recognizing phenylketonuria right away can help prevent serious health problems. </p>

PENICILLIN-ALLERGY
definition


<p>Penicillin allergy is an overreaction by your immune system to penicillin and related antibiotics. If you have a penicillin allergy, your reaction to taking the antibiotic may range from a rash to anaphylaxis, a potentially life-threatening condition. </p>
<p>Penicillin antibiotics are widely prescribed for bacterial infections, such as strep throat. However, not all unfavorable reactions to penicillin are a true penicillin allergy. </p>
<p>It isn't clear why some people develop penicillin allergy. Once you've had an allergic reaction to penicillin, the simplest way to prevent penicillin allergy is to avoid penicillin and related antibiotics. </p>



CLUSTER-HEADACHE
definition


<p>Cluster headaches occur in cyclical patterns or clusters, which gives the condition its name. Cluster headache is one of the most painful types of headache.</p>
<p>Cluster headache commonly awakens you in the middle of the night with intense pain in or around one eye on one side of your head.</p>
<p>Bouts of frequent attacks, known as cluster periods, may last from weeks to months, usually followed by remission periods when the headache attacks stop completely. During remission, no headaches occur for months and sometimes even years.</p>
<p>Fortunately, cluster headache is rare and not life-threatening. Treatments can help make cluster headache attacks shorter and less severe. In addition, medications can help reduce the number of cluster headaches.</p>



RECURRENT-BREAST-CANCER
definition


<p>Recurrent breast cancer is breast cancer that comes back after initial treatment. Although the initial treatment is aimed at eliminating all cancer cells, a few may have evaded treatment and survived. These undetected cancer cells multiply, becoming recurrent breast cancer.</p>
<p>Recurrent breast cancer may occur months or years after your initial treatment. The cancer may come back in the same place as the original cancer (local recurrence), or it may spread to other areas of your body (distant recurrence).</p>
<p>Learning you have recurrent breast cancer may be harder than dealing with the initial diagnosis. But having recurrent breast cancer is far from hopeless. Treatment may eliminate local, regional or distant recurrent breast cancer. Even if a cure isn't possible, treatment may control the disease for long periods of time.</p>



PRECOCIOUS-PUBERTY
definition


<p>Precocious puberty is when a child's body begins changing into that of an adult (puberty) too soon. Puberty that begins before age 8 in girls and before age 9 in boys is considered precocious puberty.</p>
<p>Puberty includes rapid growth of bones and muscles, changes in body shape and size, and development of the body's ability to reproduce.</p>
<p>The cause of precocious puberty often can't be found. Rarely, certain conditions, such as infections, hormone disorders, tumors, brain abnormalities or injuries, may cause precocious puberty. Treatment for precocious puberty typically includes medication to delay further development.</p>



RAYNAUDS-DISEASE
definition


<p>Raynaud's (ray-NOHZ) disease is a condition that causes some areas of your body &mdash; such as your fingers, toes, the tip of your nose and your ears &mdash; to feel numb and cool in response to cold temperatures or stress. In Raynaud's disease, smaller arteries that supply blood to your skin narrow, limiting blood circulation to affected areas. </p>
<p>Women are more likely to have Raynaud's disease. It's also more common in people who live in colder climates. </p>
<p>Treatment of Raynaud's disease depends on its severity and whether you have any other health conditions. For most people, Raynaud's disease is more a nuisance than a disability. </p>



BEDBUGS
definition


<p>Bedbugs bite the exposed skin of sleeping humans to feed on their blood. Decades ago, bedbugs were eradicated from most developed nations using DDT &mdash; a pesticide that's since been banned because it's so toxic. </p>
<p>Spurred perhaps by increases in international travel, bedbugs are becoming a problem once again. The risk of encountering bedbugs increases if you spend time in places with high turnovers of nighttime guests &mdash; such as hotels, hospitals or homeless shelters. </p>
<p>Bedbugs are reddish brown, oval and flat, about the size of an apple seed. During the day, they hide in the cracks and crevices of beds, box springs, headboards and bed frames. If you have bedbugs in your home, professional extermination is recommended. </p>

TRIGGER-FINGER
definition


<p>Trigger finger, also known as stenosing tenosynovitis (stuh-NO-sing ten-o-sin-o-VIE-tis), is a condition in which one of your fingers gets stuck in a bent position. Your finger may straighten with a snap &mdash; like a trigger being pulled and released.</p>
<p>Trigger finger occurs when inflammation narrows the space within the sheath that surrounds the tendon in the affected finger. If trigger finger is severe, your finger may become locked in a bent position.</p>
<p>People whose work or hobbies require repetitive gripping actions are at higher risk of developing trigger finger. The condition is also more common in women and in anyone with diabetes. Treatment of trigger finger varies depending on the severity.</p>



TOXOPLASMOSIS
definition


<p>Toxoplasmosis (tok-so-plaz-MOE-sis) is a disease that results from infection with the Toxoplasma gondii parasite, one of the world's most common parasites.</p>
<p>Toxoplasmosis may cause flu-like symptoms in some people, but most people affected never develop signs and symptoms. For infants born to infected mothers and for people with weakened immune systems, toxoplasmosis can cause extremely serious complications.</p>
<p>If you're generally healthy, you probably won't need any treatment for toxoplasmosis. If you are pregnant or have lowered immunity, certain medications can help reduce the infection's severity. The best approach, though, is prevention.</p>



ASCARIASIS
definition


<p>Ascariasis (as-kuh-RIE-uh-sis) is a type of roundworm infection. These worms are parasites that use your body as a host to mature from larvae or eggs to adult worms and reproduce. Adult worms can be more than a foot (30 centimeters) long. </p>
<p>Ascariasis is one of the most common human worm infections worldwide, although it's uncommon in the United States. Because most people have such mild cases of ascariasis, they have no symptoms. But when your body is infested with hundreds of worms, serious symptoms and complications can occur. </p>
<p>Ascariasis occurs most often in young children and is most prevalent in tropical and subtropical regions of the world &mdash; especially in areas where sanitation and hygiene are poor. In the United States, ascariasis is most likely to occur in rural areas of the Southeast. </p>



DIABETIC-KETOACIDOSIS
definition


<p>Diabetic ketoacidosis is a serious complication of diabetes that occurs when your body produces high levels of blood acids called ketones. </p>
<p>Diabetic ketoacidosis develops when your body is unable to produce enough insulin. Insulin normally plays a key role in helping sugar (glucose) &mdash; a major source of energy for your muscles and other tissues &mdash; enter your cells. Without enough insulin, your body begins to break down fat as an alternate fuel. This process produces a buildup of toxic acids in the bloodstream called ketones, eventually leading to diabetic ketoacidosis if untreated. </p>
<p>If you have diabetes or you're at risk of diabetes, learn the warning signs of diabetic ketoacidosis &mdash; and know when to seek emergency care. </p>



OBESITY
definition


<p>Obesity is a complex disorder involving an excessive amount of body fat. Obesity isn't just a cosmetic concern. It increases your risk of diseases and health problems such as heart disease, diabetes and high blood pressure.</p>
<p>Being extremely obese means you are especially likely to have health problems related to your weight.</p>
<p>The good news is that even modest weight loss can improve or prevent the health problems associated with obesity. Dietary changes, increased physical activity and behavior changes can help you lose weight. Prescription medications or weight-loss surgery also may be options for treating obesity.</p>

HEPATOPULMONARY-SYNDROME
definition


<p>Hepatopulmonary (hep-uh-toe-POOL-moe-nar-ee) syndrome is an uncommon condition that occurs in people with an existing liver disease that has advanced to the point it affects their lungs. People with hepatopulmonary syndrome have low blood oxygen levels (hypoxemia) caused by widespread dilation (expansion) of the lung blood vessels, both in size and number. The dilated vessels make it hard for the lungs to deliver an adequate supply of oxygen to the body. <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.org/liver-transplant/">Liver transplant</a> is the only cure for the syndrome.</p>

ANTIBIOTIC-ASSOCIATED-DIARRHEA
definition


<p>Antibiotic-associated diarrhea describes frequent, watery bowel movements (diarrhea) that occur in response to medications used to treat bacterial infections (antibiotics). </p>
<p>Most often, antibiotic-associated diarrhea is mild and clears up shortly after you stop taking the antibiotic. But in some cases, antibiotic-associated diarrhea leads to colitis, an inflammation of your colon, or a more serious form of colitis called pseudomembranous colitis. Both can cause abdominal pain, fever and bloody diarrhea. </p>
<p>Mild antibiotic-associated diarrhea may not require treatment. More serious antibiotic-associated diarrhea may require stopping or switching antibiotic medications. </p>



OSTEOARTHRITIS
definition


<p>Osteoarthritis is the most common form of arthritis, affecting millions of people around the world. Often called wear-and-tear arthritis, osteoarthritis occurs when the protective cartilage on the ends of your bones wears down over time. </p>
<p>While osteoarthritis can damage any joint in your body, the disorder most commonly affects joints in your hands, neck, lower back, knees and hips. </p>
<p>Osteoarthritis gradually worsens with time, and no cure exists. But osteoarthritis treatments can slow the progression of the disease, relieve pain and improve joint function.</p>



LEGG-CALVE-PERTHES-DISEASE
definition


<p>Legg-Calve-Perthes (LEG-kahl-VAY-PER-theez) disease is a childhood condition that affects the hip, where the thighbone (femur) and pelvis meet in a ball-and-socket joint.</p>
<p>Legg-Calve-Perthes disease occurs when blood supply is temporarily interrupted to the ball part (femoral head) of the hip joint. Without sufficient blood flow, the bone begins to die &mdash; so it breaks more easily and heals poorly.</p>
<p>To keep the ball part of the joint as round as possible, doctors may use a variety of treatments to keep it snug in the socket portion of the joint. The socket acts as a mold for the fractured femoral head as it heals.</p>



KYPHOSIS

ROTAVIRUS
definition


<p>Rotavirus is the most common cause of diarrhea in infants and children worldwide, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Before the development of a vaccine, most children in the United States had at least one bout with rotavirus by age 5. </p>
<p>Although rotavirus infections are unpleasant, you can treat most of them at home with extra fluids to prevent dehydration. Occasionally, severe dehydration requires intravenous fluids in the hospital. Dehydration is a serious complication of rotavirus and a major cause of childhood deaths in developing countries. </p>
<p>Vaccination can help prevent rotavirus infection in your infant. For older children and adults &mdash; who aren't as likely to develop serious symptoms of rotavirus &mdash; frequent hand-washing is the best line of defense. </p>

VESICOURETERAL-REFLUX
definition


<p>Vesicoureteral (ves-ih-koe-yoo-REE-tur-ul) reflux is the abnormal flow of urine from your bladder back up the tubes (ureters) that connect your kidneys to your bladder. Normally, urine flows only down from your kidneys to your bladder.</p>
<p>Vesicoureteral reflux is usually diagnosed in infants and children. The disorder increases the risk of urinary tract infections, which, if left untreated, can lead to kidney damage.</p>
<p>Vesicoureteral reflux can be primary or secondary. Children with primary vesicoureteral reflux are born with a defect in the valve that normally prevents urine from flowing backward from the bladder into the ureters. Secondary vesicoureteral reflux is due to a urinary tract malfunction, often caused by infection.</p>
<p>Children may outgrow primary vesicoureteral reflux. Treatment, which includes medication or surgery, aims at preventing kidney damage.</p>

ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE
definition


<p>Alzheimer's disease is a progressive disease that destroys memory and other important mental functions.</p>
<p>It's the most common cause of dementia &mdash; a group of brain disorders that results in the loss of intellectual and social skills. These changes are severe enough to interfere with day-to-day life.</p>
<p>In Alzheimer's disease, the brain cells themselves degenerate and die, causing a steady decline in memory and mental function.</p>
<p>Current Alzheimer's disease medications and management strategies may temporarily improve symptoms. This can sometimes help people with Alzheimer's disease maximize function and maintain independence.</p>
<p>But because there's no cure for Alzheimer's disease, it's important to seek supportive services and tap into your support network as early as possible.</p>



IDIOPATHIC-THROMBOCYTOPENIC-PURPURA
definition


<p>Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is a disorder that can lead to easy or excessive bruising and bleeding. The bleeding results from unusually low levels of platelets &mdash; the cells that help your blood clot. </p>
<p>Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, which is also called immune thrombocytopenic purpura, affects both children and adults. Children often develop idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura after a viral infection and usually recover fully without treatment. In adults, however, the disorder is often chronic. </p>
<p>Treatment of idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura depends on your symptoms, your platelet count and your age. If you don't have signs of bleeding and your platelet count isn't too low, treatment for idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura usually isn't necessary. More serious cases may be treated with medications or, in critical situations, with surgery. </p>



AORTIC-VALVE-REGURGITATION
definition


<p>Aortic valve regurgitation &mdash; or aortic regurgitation &mdash; is a condition that occurs when your heart's aortic valve doesn't close tightly. Aortic valve regurgitation allows some of the blood that was just pumped out of your heart's main pumping chamber (left ventricle) to leak back into it.</p>
<p>The leakage may prevent your heart from efficiently pumping blood to the rest of your body. As a result, you may feel fatigued and short of breath.</p>
<p>Aortic valve regurgitation can develop suddenly or over decades. Once aortic valve regurgitation becomes severe, surgery is often required to repair or replace the aortic valve.</p>

PLACENTAL-ABRUPTION
definition


<p>Placental abruption (abruptio placentae) is an uncommon yet serious complication of pregnancy. </p>
<p>The placenta is a structure that develops in the uterus during pregnancy to nourish the growing baby. If the placenta peels away from the inner wall of the uterus before delivery &mdash; either partially or completely &mdash; it's known as placental abruption. Placental abruption can deprive the baby of oxygen and nutrients and cause heavy bleeding in the mother. </p>
<p>Placental abruption often happens suddenly. Left untreated, placental abruption puts both mother and baby in jeopardy. </p>



BRUCELLOSIS
definition


<p>Brucellosis is a bacterial infection that spreads from animals to people &mdash; most often via unpasteurized milk, cheese and other dairy products. More rarely, the bacteria that cause brucellosis can spread through the air or through direct contact with infected animals.</p>
<p>Brucellosis symptoms may include fever, joint pain and fatigue. The infection can usually be treated successfully with antibiotics. Treatment takes several weeks to months, however, and relapses are common.</p>
<p>While brucellosis is uncommon in the United States, the disease affects hundreds of thousands of people and animals worldwide. Avoiding unpasteurized dairy products and taking precautions when working with animals or in a laboratory can help prevent brucellosis.</p>



INDIGESTION
definition


<p>Indigestion &mdash; also called dyspepsia or an upset stomach &mdash; is a general term that describes discomfort in your upper abdomen. Indigestion is not a disease, but rather some symptoms you experience, including abdominal pain and a feeling of fullness soon after you start eating. Although indigestion is common, how you experience indigestion may differ from other people. Symptoms of indigestion may be felt occasionally or as often as daily. </p>
<p>Indigestion can be a symptom of another digestive disease. Indigestion that isn't caused by an underlying disease may be eased with lifestyle changes and medication.</p>

BREAST-CYSTS
definition


<p>Breast cysts are fluid-filled sacs within your breast, which are usually not cancer (benign). You can have one or many breast cysts. They're often described as round or oval lumps with distinct edges. In texture, a breast cyst usually feels like a grape or a water-filled balloon, but sometimes a breast cyst feels firm. </p>
<p>Breast cysts don't require treatment unless a cyst is large and painful or otherwise uncomfortable. In that case, draining the fluid from a breast cyst can ease your symptoms. </p>
<p>Breast cysts are common in women before menopause, between ages 35 and 50, but can be found in women of any age. If you have breast cysts, they usually disappear after menopause, unless you're taking hormone therapy. </p>



GENERALIZED-ANXIETY-DISORDER
definition


<p>It's normal to feel anxious from time to time, especially if your life is stressful. However, severe, ongoing anxiety that interferes with day-to-day activities may be a sign of generalized anxiety disorder. </p>
<p>It's possible to develop generalized anxiety disorder as a child or as an adult. Generalized anxiety disorder has similar symptoms as panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder and other types of anxiety, but they're all different conditions. </p>
<p>Living with generalized anxiety disorder can be a long-term challenge. In many cases, it occurs along with other anxiety or mood disorders. In most cases, generalized anxiety disorder improves with medications or psychological counseling (psychotherapy). Making lifestyle changes, learning coping skills and using relaxation techniques also can help.</p>



LIVER-FAILURE
definition


<p>Acute liver failure is loss of liver function that occurs rapidly &mdash; in days or weeks &mdash;usually in a person who has no pre-existing liver disease. Acute liver failure is less common than chronic liver failure, which develops more slowly.</p>
<p>Acute liver failure, also known as fulminant hepatic failure, can cause serious complications, including excessive bleeding and increasing pressure in the brain. It's a medical emergency that requires hospitalization.</p>
<p>Depending on the cause, acute liver failure can sometimes be reversed with treatment. In many situations, though, a liver transplant may be the only cure.</p>



CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM-VASCULAR-MALFORMATIONS

HAY-FEVER
definition


<p>Hay fever, also called allergic rhinitis, causes cold-like signs and symptoms, such as a runny nose, itchy eyes, congestion, sneezing and sinus pressure. But unlike a cold, hay fever isn't caused by a virus. Hay fever is caused by an allergic response to outdoor or indoor allergens, such as pollen, dust mites or pet dander. </p>
<p>Hay fever can make you miserable and affect your performance at work or school and interfere with leisure activities. But you don't have to put up with annoying symptoms. Learning how to avoid triggers and finding the right treatment can make a big difference. </p>



VARICOCELE
definition


<p>A varicocele (VAR-ih-koe-seel) is an enlargement of the veins within the scrotum, the loose bag of skin that holds your testicles. A varicocele is similar to a varicose vein that can occur in your leg. </p>
<p>Varicoceles are a common cause of low sperm production and decreased sperm quality, which can cause infertility. However, not all varicoceles affect sperm production. Varicoceles can also cause testicles to shrink. </p>
<p>Most varicoceles develop over time. Fortunately, most varicoceles are easy to diagnose and many don't need treatment. If a varicocele causes symptoms, it often can be repaired surgically. </p>



DYSTHYMIA
definition


<p>Dysthymia (dis-THIE-me-uh) is a mild but long-term (chronic) form of depression. Symptoms usually last for at least two years, and often for much longer than that. Dysthymia interferes with your ability to function and enjoy life. </p>
<p>With dysthymia, you may lose interest in normal daily activities, feel hopeless, lack productivity, and have low self-esteem and an overall feeling of inadequacy. People with dysthymia are often thought of as being overly critical, constantly complaining and incapable of having fun. </p>

CROUP
definition


<p>Croup refers to an infection of the upper airway, generally in children, which obstructs breathing and causes a characteristic barking cough. </p>
<p>The cough and other symptoms of croup are the result of inflammation around the vocal cords (larynx), windpipe (trachea) and bronchial tubes (bronchi). When a cough forces air through this narrowed passage, the swollen vocal cords produce a noise similar to a seal barking. Likewise, taking a breath often produces a high-pitched whistling sound (stridor). </p>
<p>Croup usually isn't serious and most cases can be treated at home. </p>

PATENT-FORAMEN-OVALE
definition


<p>A patent foramen ovale (PFO) is a hole in the heart that didn't close the way it should after birth. </p>
<p>During fetal development, a small flap-like opening &mdash; the foramen ovale (foh-RAY-mun oh-VAY-lee) &mdash; is usually present between the right and left upper chambers of the heart. It normally closes during infancy. When the foramen ovale doesn't close, it's called a patent foramen ovale. </p>
<p>Although it's common to have a patent formen ovale, most people with the condition never know they have it. A patent foramen ovale is often discovered during tests for other problems. Learning that you have a patent foramen ovale is understandably worrisome, but most people never need treatment for this disorder. </p>



CHRONIC-COUGH
definition


<p>A chronic cough is more than just an annoyance. A chronic cough can ruin your sleep and leave you feeling exhausted. Severe cases of chronic cough can result in vomiting, lightheadedness, depression, even rib fractures. </p>
<p>Chronic cough is defined as lasting eight weeks or longer in adults, four weeks in children. </p>
<p>While it can sometimes be difficult to pinpoint the problem that's triggering a chronic cough, the most common causes are tobacco use, postnasal drip, asthma and acid reflux &mdash; the backflow of stomach acid that can irritate your throat. Chronic cough typically disappears once the underlying problem is treated. </p>



DELAYED-EJACULATION
definition


<p>Delayed ejaculation &mdash; sometimes called impaired ejaculation &mdash; is a condition in which it takes an extended period of sexual stimulation for a man to reach sexual climax and release semen from the penis (ejaculate). Some men with delayed ejaculation are unable to ejaculate at all. </p>
<p>Delayed ejaculation can be temporary or a lifelong problem. Possible causes of delayed ejaculation include certain chronic health conditions, surgeries and medications. Treatment for delayed ejaculation depends on the underlying cause. </p>
<p>It's normal for men to have delayed ejaculation from time to time. Delayed ejaculation is only a problem if it's ongoing or causes stress for you or your partner. </p>

CONCUSSION
definition


<p>A concussion is a traumatic brain injury that alters the way your brain functions. Effects are usually temporary but can include headaches and problems with concentration, memory, balance and coordination.</p>
<p>Although concussions usually are caused by a blow to the head, they can also occur when the head and upper body are violently shaken. These injuries can cause a loss of consciousness, but most concussions do not. Because of this, some people have concussions and don't realize it. </p>
<p>Concussions are common, particularly if you play a contact sport, such as football. But every concussion injures your brain to some extent. This injury needs time and rest to heal properly. Most concussive traumatic brain injuries are mild, and people usually recover fully. </p>



MASTITIS
definition


<p>Mastitis is an infection of the breast tissue that results in breast pain, swelling, warmth and redness of the breast. If you have mastitis, you might also experience fever and chills. Mastitis most commonly affects women who are breast-feeding (lactation mastitis), although sometimes this condition can occur in women who aren't breast-feeding. </p>
<p>In most cases, lactation mastitis occurs within the first three months after giving birth (postpartum), but it can happen later during breast-feeding. The condition can leave you feeling exhausted and run-down, making it difficult to care for your baby. </p>
<p>Sometimes mastitis leads a mother to wean her baby before she intends to. But you can continue breast-feeding while you have mastitis. </p>



INHERITED-METABOLIC-DISORDERS
definition


<p>Inherited metabolic disorders refer to different types of medical conditions caused by genetic defects &mdash; most commonly inherited from both parents &mdash; that interfere with the body's metabolism. Metabolism is the complex set of chemical reactions that your body uses to maintain life, including energy production. Special enzymes break down food or certain chemicals so your body can use them right away for fuel or store them. Also, certain chemical processes break down substances that your body no longer needs, or make those it lacks.</p>
<p>When these chemical processes don't work properly due to a hormone or enzyme deficiency, a metabolic disorder occurs. Inherited metabolic disorders fall into different categories, depending on the specific substance and whether it builds up in harmful amounts (because it can't be broken down), it's too low, or it's missing. Some metabolic disorders can be diagnosed by routine screening tests done at birth. Others are identified only after a child or adult shows symptoms of a disorder.</p>



MESENTERIC-ISCHEMIA
definition


<p>Mesenteric ischemia (is-KE-me-uh) is a chronic condition caused by poor blood supply to your intestines. It results from narrowing in one or more of the arteries supplying blood to your intestines (visceral arteries). It also can occur suddenly as a result of a blood clot severely restricting blood flow (acute mesenteric ischemia). Lack of oxygen-rich blood can permanently damage your intestines. You may experience sudden abdominal pain and, less often, bloody stools. This situation requires immediate medical care.</p>
<p>Chronic mesenteric ischemia occurs gradually as the main visceral arteries narrow. You may develop pain after eating, lose weight or develop a fear of eating caused by fear of stomach pain.</p>

RECTOVAGINAL-FISTULA
definition


<p>A rectovaginal fistula is an abnormal connection between the lower portion of your large intestine &mdash; your rectum &mdash; and your vagina. Contents of your bowel can leak through the fistula, meaning you might pass gas or stool through your vagina. </p>
<p>A rectovaginal fistula may result from an injury during childbirth, Crohn's disease or other inflammatory bowel disease, radiation treatment or cancer in the pelvic area, or a complication following surgery in the pelvic area. </p>
<p>The symptoms of a rectovaginal fistula often cause emotional distress as well as physical discomfort, which can impact self-esteem and intimate relationships. Though bringing up the subject with your doctor may be difficult, it's important to have a rectovaginal fistula evaluated. Some rectovaginal fistulas may close on their own, but most need to be repaired surgically. </p>



RHEUMATOID-ARTHRITIS
definition


<p>Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic inflammatory disorder that typically affects the small joints in your hands and feet. Unlike the wear-and-tear damage of osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis affects the lining of your joints, causing a painful swelling that can eventually result in bone erosion and joint deformity. </p>
<p>An autoimmune disorder, rheumatoid arthritis occurs when your immune system mistakenly attacks your own body's tissues. In addition to causing joint problems, rheumatoid arthritis sometimes can affect other organs of the body &mdash; such as the skin, eyes, lungs and blood vessels. </p>
<p>Although rheumatoid arthritis can occur at any age, it usually begins after age 40. The disorder is much more common in women than in men. Treatment focuses on controlling symptoms and preventing joint damage.</p>

<p>If you cough, wheeze or feel out of breath during or after exercise, it may be more than exertion causing your symptoms. You might have exercise-induced asthma. As with asthma triggered by other things, exercise-induced asthma symptoms occur when your airways tighten and produce extra mucus. </p>
<p>If you have exercise-induced asthma &mdash; also called exercise-induced bronchospasm (BRONG-ko-spaz-um) &mdash; physical exertion may be the only thing that triggers your symptoms. Or, exercise may be just one of several things that trigger your asthma. But having exercise-induced asthma doesn't mean you shouldn't exercise.

ANTIPHOSPHOLIPID-SYNDROME
definition


<p>Antiphospholipid syndrome occurs when your immune system mistakenly attacks some of the normal proteins in your blood. Antiphospholipid syndrome can cause blood clots to form within your arteries or veins. It can also cause pregnancy complications, such as miscarriage and stillbirth.</p>
<p>Antiphospholipid syndrome may cause blood clots to form in your leg veins, a condition known as deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Antiphospholipid syndrome may also cause blood clots to form in organs such as your kidneys or lungs. Damage depends on the extent and location of the clot. For instance, a clot in your brain can cause stroke.</p>
<p>There's no cure for antiphospholipid syndrome, but medications can be effective in reducing your risk of blood clots.</p>



FAMILIAL-ADENOMATOUS-POLYPOSIS
definition


<p>Familial adenomatous polyposis is a rare, inherited condition that causes extra tissue (polyps) to form in your large intestine and in the upper part of your small intestine (duodenum). If untreated, the polyps in the large intestine almost always become cancerous by age 40.</p>
<p>Most people with familial adenomatous polyposis eventually need surgery to remove the upper part of the large intestine (colon) to prevent cancer. The polyps in the duodenum can also develop cancer, but they can usually be managed by removing them regularly.</p>
<h2>About</h2>
<p>Familial adenomatous polyposis is caused by a defect in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene. Most people inherit the genetic abnormality from a parent. But in about 30 percent of cases, the genetic mutation occurs spontaneously at conception.</p>
<p>The abnormal gene causes hundreds or even thousands of <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.org/colon-polyps/">polyps</a> to grow in your colon and rectum, usually starting by your midteens. The polyps are nearly 100 percent certain to develop into <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.org/colon-cancer/">colon cancer</a> or <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.org/rectal-cancer/">rectal cancer</a> by the time you are 40.</p>
<p>Familial adenomatous polyposis can cause other complications:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Duodenal polyps.</strong> These polyps grow in the upper part of your small intestine and may become cancerous. But with careful monitoring, duodenal polyps can often be detected and removed before cancer develops.</li>
    <li><strong>Periampullary polyps.</strong> These polyps arise in the duodenum, close to where the bile and pancreas ducts enter it (ampulla). Periampullary polyps also may become cancerous but can often be detected and removed before cancer develops.</li>
    <li><strong>Desmoids.</strong> These noncancerous masses can arise anywhere in the body, but often develop in the stomach area (abdomen). Desmoids can cause serious problems if they grow into nerves or blood vessels or exert pressure on other organs in your body.</li>
    <li><strong>Other cancers.</strong> Rarely, familial adenomatous polyposis can cause cancer to develop in your <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.org/thyroid-cancer/">thyroid</a> gland, central nervous system, <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.org/adrenal-cancer/">adrenal glands</a>, <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.org/liver-cancer/">liver</a> or other organs.</li>
    <li><strong>Noncancerous skin tumors.</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Noncancerous <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.org/bone-cancer/">bone tumors</a>.</strong><strong> </strong></li>
    <li><strong>Pigment changes in the retina of your eye.</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Dental abnormalities.</strong></li>
</ul>
<h2>Types</h2>
<p>Familial adenomatous polyposis has these variations:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Attenuated familial adenomatous polyposis</strong> causes fewer polyps than classic familial adenomatous polyposis, usually less than 100. You have a high likelihood of developing colon cancer by age 60 if the polyps are not removed.</li>
    <li><strong>Gardner's syndrome</strong> is a form of familial adenomatous polyposis that also causes bony and dental growths.</li>
</ul>
<h3>MYH-associated polyposis (MAP)</h3>
<p>This rare genetic disorder is caused by a different gene (the MYH gene), but has similar colon and duodenum risks. The number of polyps can vary, with up to 40 percent of people with MAP having 10 to 100 polyps, and up to 30 percent having more than 100 polyps. The risk of developing colon cancer is estimated to be 80 percent by age 70, if the polyps cannot be controlled with colonoscopy or if the colon and rectum are not removed.</p>
<p>At Mayo Clinic, people with MAP have colonoscopies every year, beginning at age 25.</p>



COPD
definition


<p>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) refers to a group of lung diseases that block airflow and make breathing difficult.</p>
<p>Emphysema and chronic bronchitis are the two most common conditions that make up COPD. Chronic bronchitis is an inflammation of the lining of your bronchial tubes, which carry air to and from your lungs. Emphysema occurs when the air sacs (alveoli) at the end of the smallest air passages (bronchioles) in the lungs are gradually destroyed.</p>
<p>Damage to your lungs from COPD can't be reversed, but treatment can help control symptoms and minimize further damage.</p>



PERIPHERAL-NERVE-TUMORS-BENIGN
definition


<p>Your peripheral nerves link your brain and spinal cord to other parts of your body. These nerves control your muscles so that you can walk, blink, swallow, pick things up and do other activities.</p>
<p>Several types of nerve tumors occur. Though their cause is usually unknown, some are hereditary. Most tumors aren't cancerous (malignant), but they can lead to nerve damage and loss of muscle control. That's why it's important to see your doctor when you have any unusual lump, pain, tingling or numbness.</p>

URETERAL-OBSTRUCTION
definition


<p>A ureteral obstruction is a blockage in one or both of the tubes (ureters) that lead from the kidneys to the bladder. Ureteral obstruction can be a curable condition. However, if it's not treated, symptoms can quickly move from mild (pain, fever, infection) to severe (loss of kidney function, sepsis, even death).</p>



PREGNANCY-LOSS-MISCARRIAGE
definition


<p>Miscarriage is the spontaneous loss of a pregnancy before the 20th week. About 10 to 20 percent of known pregnancies end in miscarriage. But the actual number is probably much higher because many miscarriages occur so early in pregnancy that a woman doesn't even know she's pregnant. </p>
<p>Miscarriage is a somewhat loaded term &mdash; possibly suggesting that something was amiss in the carrying of the pregnancy. This is rarely true. Most miscarriages occur because the fetus isn't developing normally. However, because these abnormalities are rarely understood, it's often difficult to determine what causes them. </p>
<p>Miscarriage is a relatively common experience &mdash; but that doesn't make it any easier. Take a step toward emotional healing by understanding what can cause a miscarriage, what increases the risk and what medical care might be needed. </p>

NIEMANN-PICK
definition


<p>Niemann-Pick disease primarily affects children, although it can occur at any age. Types A, B and C all affect the body's ability to metabolize fat (cholesterol and lipids) within cells. When cholesterol and other lipids accumulate in large amounts within cells, they cause cell dysfunction and ultimately cell death. Niemann-Pick disease can affect the brain, nerves, liver, spleen and bone marrow and, in severe cases, the lungs. Progressive deterioration of the brain, nerves and organs cause the main symptoms. Niemann-Pick is an inherited disease with no known cure, but research continues.</p>



YIPS
definition


<p>Yips are involuntary wrist spasms that occur most commonly when golfers are trying to putt. However, the yips can also affect people who play other sports &mdash; such as cricket, darts and baseball.</p>
<p>It was once thought that the yips were always associated with performance anxiety. However, it now appears that some people have yips that are caused by a focal dystonia, which is a neurological dysfunction affecting specific muscles.</p>
<p>Some people have found relief from the yips by changing the way they perform the affected task. For example, a right-handed golfer might try putting left-handed. </p>



SEXUALLY-TRANSMITTED-DISEASES-STDS
definition


<p>Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), or sexually transmitted infections (STIs), are generally acquired by sexual contact. The organisms that cause sexually transmitted diseases may pass from person to person in blood, semen, or vaginal and other bodily fluids.</p>
<p>Some such infections can also be transmitted nonsexually, such as from mother to infant during pregnancy or childbirth, or through blood transfusions or shared needles.</p>
<p>It's possible to contract sexually transmitted diseases from people who seem perfectly healthy &mdash; people who, in fact, aren't even aware of being infected. Many STDs cause no symptoms in some people, which is one of the reasons experts prefer the term "sexually transmitted infections" to "sexually transmitted diseases."</p>



DIABETIC-HYPEROSMOLAR-SYNDROME
definition


<p>Diabetic hyperosmolar (hi-pur-oz-MOE-lur) syndrome is a serious condition that develops when your blood sugar reaches a very high level. When your blood sugar gets to this level, your blood becomes thick and syrupy, causing diabetic hyperosmolar syndrome. Excess sugar passes from your blood into your urine, triggering a filtering process that draws tremendous amounts of fluid from your body. </p>
<p>Diabetic hyperosmolar syndrome usually affects people with type 2 diabetes, and may develop in people who haven't yet been diagnosed with diabetes. </p>
<p>Left untreated, diabetic hyperosmolar syndrome can lead to life-threatening dehydration. Prompt medical care is essential. </p>

DISSOCIATIVE-DISORDERS
definition


<p>Someone with a dissociative disorder escapes reality in ways that are involuntary and unhealthy. The person with a dissociative disorder experiences a disconnection and lack of continuity between thoughts, memories, surroundings, actions and identity.</p>
<p>The symptoms of dissociative disorders &mdash; ranging from amnesia to alternate identities &mdash; depend in part on the type you have. Symptoms usually develop as a reaction to trauma and help keep difficult memories at bay. Times of stress can temporarily worsen symptoms, making them more obvious. Dissociative disorders cause problems with functioning in everyday life.</p>
<p>Treatment for dissociative disorders may include talk therapy (psychotherapy) and medication.&nbsp;Although treating dissociative disorders can be difficult, many people learn new ways of coping and lead healthy, productive lives.</p>

definition


<p>Typhoid fever is caused by Salmonella typhi bacteria. Typhoid fever is rare in industrialized countries. However, it remains a serious health threat in the developing world, especially for children. </p>
<p>Typhoid fever spreads through contaminated food and water or through close contact with someone who's infected. Signs and symptoms usually include high fever, headache, abdominal pain, and either constipation or diarrhea. </p>
<p>When treated with antibiotics, most people with typhoid fever feel better within a few days, although a small percentage of them may die of complications. </p>
<p>Vaccines against typhoid fever are available, but they're only partially effective. Vaccines usually are reserved for those who may be exposed to the disease or are traveling to areas where typhoid fever is common. </p>

ANXIETY
definition


<p>Experiencing occasional anxiety is a normal part of life. However, people with anxiety disorders frequently have intense, excessive and persistent worry and fear about everyday situations. Often, anxiety disorders involve repeated episodes of sudden feelings of intense anxiety and fear or terror that reach a peak within minutes (panic attacks). </p>
<p>These feelings of anxiety and panic interfere with daily activities, are difficult to control, are out of proportion to the actual danger and can last a long time. Symptoms may start during childhood or the teen years and continue into adulthood.</p>
<p>Examples of anxiety disorders include social anxiety disorder (social phobia), specific phobias and separation anxiety disorder. A person can have more than one anxiety disorder.</p>
<p>Sometimes anxiety results from a medical condition that needs treatment. Whatever form of anxiety you have, treatment can help.</p>

definition


<p>Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome is an infectious disease characterized by flu-like symptoms that can progress rapidly to potentially life-threatening breathing problems.</p>
<p>Several types of hantaviruses can cause hantavirus pulmonary syndrome. They are carried by several types of rodents, particularly the deer mouse. You become infected primarily by breathing air infected with hantaviruses that are shed in rodent urine and droppings.</p>
<p>Because treatment options are limited, the best protection against hantavirus pulmonary syndrome is to avoid rodents and their habitats.</p>

VASCULAR-DEMENTIA
definition


<p>Vascular dementia is a general term describing problems with reasoning, planning, judgment, memory and other thought processes caused by brain damage from impaired blood flow to your brain.</p>
<p>You can develop vascular dementia after a stroke blocks an artery in your brain, but strokes don't always cause vascular dementia. Whether a stroke affects your thinking and reasoning depends on your stroke's severity and location. Vascular dementia also can result from other conditions that damage blood vessels and reduce circulation, depriving your brain of vital oxygen and nutrients.</p>
<p>Factors that increase your risk of heart disease and stroke &mdash; including high blood pressure, high cholesterol and smoking &mdash; also raise your vascular dementia risk. Controlling these factors can help lower your chances of developing vascular dementia.</p>



CEREBRAL-PALSY
definition


<p>Cerebral palsy is a disorder of movement, muscle tone or posture that is caused by an insult to the immature, developing brain, most often before birth.</p>
<p>Signs and symptoms appear during infancy or preschool years. In general, cerebral palsy causes impaired movement associated with exaggerated reflexes, floppiness or rigidity of the limbs and trunk, abnormal posture, involuntary movements, unsteadiness of walking, or some combination of these.</p>
<p>People with cerebral palsy may have difficulty with swallowing and commonly have eye muscle imbalance. People with cerebral palsy may have reduced range of motion at various joints of their bodies due to muscle stiffness.</p>
<p>The effect of cerebral palsy on functional abilities varies greatly. Some people are able to walk while others aren't able to walk. Some people show normal to near normal intellectual function, but others may have intellectual disabilities. Epilepsy, blindness or deafness also may be present.</p>
<p>People with cerebral palsy often have underlying developmental brain abnormalities.</p>



MORPHEA
definition


<p>Morphea (mor-FEE-uh) is a rare skin condition that causes reddish or purplish patches on your skin. Morphea is a localized or limited form of scleroderma, a condition that can cause a wide variety of problems, from skin discoloration to difficulty with the function of joints and muscles and other connective tissues. </p>
<p>Morphea typically appears on your abdomen, chest or back, but it can affect your face, arms and legs. Morphea tends to affect only the outermost layers of your skin &mdash; the dermis and the fatty tissue just beneath the dermis. Sometimes, morphea can restrict movement in your joints. </p>
<p>Morphea generally subsides on its own over time. With morphea, you may be concerned about your appearance. Your doctor may recommend medications and other treatments to help with your appearance and other symptoms of morphea.</p>



PNEUMONIA
definition


<p>Pneumonia is an infection that inflames the air sacs in one or both lungs. The air sacs may fill with fluid or pus, causing cough with phlegm or pus, fever, chills and difficulty breathing. A variety of organisms, including bacteria, viruses and fungi, can cause pneumonia. </p>
<p>Pneumonia can range in seriousness from mild to life-threatening. It is most serious for infants and young children, people older than age 65, and people with underlying health problems or weakened immune systems. </p>
<p>Antibiotics and antiviral medications can treat many common forms of pneumonia. </p>



SELECTIVE-IGA-DEFICIENCY
definition


<p>Selective IgA deficiency is an immune system condition in which you lack or don't have enough immunoglobulin A (IgA), a protein that fights infection (antibody). Most people with selective IgA deficiency don't have recurrent infections. However, some people who have IgA deficiency experience recurrent respiratory tract infections, asthma, sinus infections, allergies and diarrhea.</p>
<p>Selective IgA deficiency may also be found with autoimmune disease, in which your immune system attacks itself. Common autoimmune conditions found with IgA deficiency include rheumatoid arthritis, lupus and celiac disease.</p>

PERICARDIAL-EFFUSION
definition


<p>Pericardial effusion (per-e-KAHR-dee-ul uh-FU-zhun) occurs when too much fluid builds up around the heart. </p>
<p>The heart is surrounded by a double-layered, sac-like structure called the pericardium. The space between the layers normally contains a very small amount of fluid. </p>
<p>But if the pericardium is diseased or injured, the resulting inflammation can lead to pericardial effusion. Fluid can also build up around the heart without inflammation. Sometimes, pericardial effusion can be caused by the accumulation of blood after a surgical procedure or injury. </p>
<p>When the amount of fluid exceeds the pericardium's "full" level, pericardial effusion puts pressure on the heart, causing poor heart function. If left untreated, pericardial effusion can cause heart failure or even death. </p>



TYPE-2-DIABETES
definition


<p>Type 2 diabetes, once known as adult-onset or noninsulin-dependent diabetes, is a chronic condition that affects the way your body metabolizes sugar (glucose), your body's important source of fuel.</p>
<p>With type 2 diabetes, your body either resists the effects of insulin &mdash; a hormone that regulates the movement of sugar into your cells &mdash; or doesn't produce enough insulin to maintain a normal glucose level.</p>
<p>More common in adults, type 2 diabetes increasingly affects children as childhood obesity increases. There's no cure for type 2 diabetes, but you may be able to manage the condition by eating well, exercising and maintaining a healthy weight. If diet and exercise aren't enough to manage your blood sugar well, you also may need diabetes medications or insulin therapy.</p>



DESMOID-TUMORS
definition


<p>Desmoid tumors are noncancerous growths that occur in the connective tissue. Desmoid tumors most often occur in the arms, legs and abdomen.</p>
<p>Another term for desmoid tumors is aggressive fibromatosis.</p>
<p>Desmoid tumors that grow can extend to involve nearby tissues and organs, causing signs, symptoms and complications.</p>
<p>Treatment may involve surgery to remove the desmoid tumor, when possible. Sometimes the tumor can't be removed without damaging nearby structures. In these cases, other treatments may be recommended.</p>



HEART-PALPITATIONS
definition


<p>Heart palpitations (pal-pih-TAY-shuns) are the feelings of having rapid, fluttering or pounding heart. Heart palpitations can be triggered by stress, exercise, medication or, rarely, a medical condition.</p>
<p>Although heart palpitations can be worrisome, they're usually harmless. In rare cases, heart palpitations can be a symptom of a more serious heart condition, such as an irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia), that may require treatment.</p>



LATEX-ALLERGY
definition


<p>Latex allergy is a reaction to certain proteins found in natural rubber latex, a product manufactured from a milky fluid that comes from the rubber tree. If you have a latex allergy, your body mistakes latex for a harmful substance. </p>
<p>Latex allergy may cause allergic reactions ranging from sneezing or a runny nose to anaphylaxis, a potentially life-threatening condition. Your doctor may determine if you have a latex allergy or if you're at risk of developing a latex allergy. </p>
<p>Understanding latex allergy and becoming familiar with common sources of latex can help you prevent your own allergic reactions or those of someone else. </p>

PERITONITIS
definition


<p>Peritonitis is a bacterial or fungal infection of the peritoneum, a silk-like membrane that lines your inner abdominal wall and covers the organs within your abdomen. Peritonitis can result from any rupture (perforation) in your abdomen, or as a complication of other medical conditions. </p>
<p>Peritonitis requires prompt medical attention to fight the infection and, if necessary, to treat any underlying medical conditions. Treatment of peritonitis usually involves antibiotics and, in some cases, surgery. Left untreated, peritonitis can lead to severe, potentially life-threatening infection throughout your body. </p>
<p>If you're receiving peritoneal dialysis, you can help prevent peritonitis by following good hygiene before, during and after dialysis. </p>



SPERMATOCELE
definition


<p>A spermatocele (SPUR-muh-toe-seal) is an abnormal sac (cyst) that develops in the epididymis &mdash; the small, coiled tube located on the upper testicle that collects and transports sperm. Generally painless and noncancerous, a spermatocele usually is filled with milky or clear fluid that may contain sperm. </p>
<p>The exact cause of spermatoceles is unknown but may be due to a blockage in one of the tubes that drains sperm. </p>
<p>Spermatoceles, sometimes called spermatic cysts, are common. They typically don't reduce fertility or require treatment. If a spermatocele grows large enough to cause discomfort, your doctor may suggest surgery. </p>

GINGIVITIS
definition


<p>Gingivitis is a common and mild form of gum disease (periodontal disease) that causes irritation, redness and swelling (inflammation) of your gums. Because gingivitis can be mild, you may not be aware that you have the condition. But it's important to take gingivitis seriously and treat it promptly. Gingivitis can lead to much more serious gum disease (periodontitis) and eventual tooth loss.</p>
<p>The most common cause of gingivitis is poor oral hygiene. Good oral health habits, such as brushing at least twice a day, flossing daily and getting regular dental checkups, can help prevent gingivitis.</p>

ADHD
definition


<p>Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a chronic condition that affects millions of children and often persists into adulthood. ADHD includes a combination of problems, such as difficulty sustaining attention, hyperactivity and impulsive behavior. </p>
<p>Children with ADHD also may struggle with low self-esteem, troubled relationships and poor performance in school. Symptoms sometimes lessen with age. However, some people never completely outgrow their ADHD symptoms. But they can learn strategies to be successful. </p>
<p>While treatment won't cure ADHD, it can help a great deal with symptoms. Treatment typically involves medications and behavioral interventions. Early diagnosis and treatment can make a big difference in outcome. </p>



SCLEROSING-MESENTERITIS
definition


<p>Sclerosing mesenteritis occurs when the tissue (mesentery) that holds the small intestines in place becomes inflamed and forms scar tissue. Sclerosing mesenteritis is rare, and it's not clear what causes it.</p>
<p>Sclerosing mesenteritis can cause abdominal pain, bloating and diarrhea. But some people experience no signs and symptoms and may never need treatment.</p>
<p>In rare cases, scar tissue formed by sclerosing mesenteritis can block food from moving through your digestive tract. Surgery may be necessary in this situation.</p>



SLEEP-RELATED-EATING-DISORDER
definition


<p>People with a sleep-related eating disorder have frequent episodes of compulsive eating while sleepwalking during the night. The person has impaired consciousness while preparing food and eating it, with little or no memory of these actions the next morning.</p>
<p>A sleep-related eating disorder can cause dangerous use of kitchen appliances or injury from eating something toxic.&nbsp;Typically the person eats high-carbohydrate and high-fat foods during the episode but may also eat bizarre items, such as coffee grounds, frozen food or cigarette butts.&nbsp;This disorder can lead to problems such as weight gain, poor diabetes control or dental cavities.</p>
<p>Sleep-related eating disorder is more common in women&nbsp;and typically starts when people are in their 20s. It often occurs in people who have restless legs syndrome and may be a related condition.&nbsp;Sleep-related eating disorder may also be linked to other sleep disorders, such as <a href="/diseases-conditions/obstructive-sleep-apnea/basics/definition/con-20027941">obstructive sleep apnea</a>, and it can be a side effect of short-acting sleep medications, such as zolpidem (Ambien, Edluar, Zolpimist).</p>



BORDERLINE-PERSONALITY-DISORDER

PREMATURE-OVARIAN-FAILURE
definition


<p>Premature ovarian failure &mdash; also known as primary ovarian insufficiency &mdash; refers to a loss of normal function of your ovaries before age 40. If your ovaries fail, they don't produce normal amounts of the hormone estrogen or release eggs regularly. Infertility is a common result.</p>
<p>Premature ovarian failure is sometimes referred to as premature menopause, but the two conditions aren't exactly the same. Women with premature ovarian failure may have irregular or occasional periods for years and may even become pregnant. Women with premature menopause stop having periods and can't become pregnant.</p>
<p>Restoring estrogen levels in women with premature ovarian failure helps prevent some complications, such as osteoporosis, but infertility is harder to treat.</p>



POSTERIOR-CORTICAL-ATROPHY
definition


<p>Posterior cortical atrophy is a rare, degenerative brain and nervous system disorder (neurological condition) that causes your vision to decline. The vision problems result from a disease of your brain. Common symptoms include difficulties with reading, recognizing common objects and recognizing familiar faces. It may eventually cause your memory and thinking abilities (cognitive skills) to decline. Posterior cortical atrophy may be associated with <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.org/alzheimers-disease/">Alzheimer's disease</a>, <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.org/lewy-body-dementia/">Lewy body dementia</a> or other neurological conditions.</p>



SWINE-FLU
definition


<p>Technically, the term "swine flu" refers to influenza in pigs. Occasionally, pigs transmit influenza viruses to people, mainly to hog farmers and veterinarians. Less often, someone infected passes the infection to others.</p>
<p>The human respiratory infection caused by a particular influenza virus H1N1 strain &mdash; popularly known as swine flu &mdash; was first recognized in spring 2009. A few months after the first swine flu cases were reported, rates of confirmed H1N1-related illness were increasing in much of the world. As a result, the World Health Organization declared the infection a global pandemic.</p>
<p>The pandemic was declared over in August 2010. Currently, H1N1 is still circulating in humans as a seasonal flu virus and is included in the seasonal flu vaccine.</p>



URINARY-TRACT-INFECTION
definition


<p>A urinary tract infection (UTI) is an infection in any part of your urinary system &mdash; your kidneys, ureters, bladder and urethra. Most infections involve the lower urinary tract &mdash; the bladder and the urethra. </p>
<p>Women are at greater risk of developing a UTI than men are. Infection limited to your bladder can be painful and annoying. However, serious consequences can occur if a UTI spreads to your kidneys. </p>
<p>Antibiotics are the typical treatment for a UTI. But you can take steps to reduce your chance of getting a UTI in the first place. </p>

AUTOIMMUNE-PANCREATITIS
definition


<p>Autoimmune pancreatitis is a chronic inflammation thought to be caused by the body's immune system attacking the pancreas. The disease affects not only the pancreas, but also the bile ducts in the liver, as well as the salivary glands, kidneys and lymph nodes. One type of the disease mainly affects men in their 50s and 60s; a second type can occur in children as young as 12.</p>
<p>Autoimmune pancreatitis is a rare disease and can be mistakenly diagnosed as <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.org/pancreatic-cancer/">pancreatic cancer</a>. Both conditions have similar signs and symptoms, but very different treatments, so it is crucial to distinguish one from another. Autoimmune pancreatitis is treated with steroids, which improve the condition in many people, often dramatically.</p>



ALLERGIES
definition


<p>Allergies occur when your immune system reacts to a foreign substance &mdash; such as pollen, bee venom or pet dander &mdash; that doesn't cause a reaction in most people.</p>
<p>Your immune system produces substances known as antibodies. Some antibodies protect you from unwanted invaders that could make you sick or cause infection.</p>
<p>When you have allergies, your immune system makes antibodies that identify a particular allergen as harmful, even though it isn't. When you come into contact with the allergen, your immune system's reaction can inflame your skin, sinuses, airways or digestive system.</p>
<p>The severity of allergies varies from person to person and can range from minor irritation to anaphylaxis &mdash; a potentially life-threatening emergency. While most allergies can't be cured, a number of treatments can help relieve your allergy symptoms.</p>

VENTRICULAR-TACHYCARDIA
definition


<p>Ventricular tachycardia is a condition in which the lower chambers of your heart (ventricles) beat very quickly. Ventricular tachycardia is a type of <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.org/tachycardia/">tachycardia</a>, a condition in which your heart beats quicker than normal because of a problem in your heart's electrical system.</p>
<p>In ventricular tachycardia, your heart may not be able to pump enough blood to your body and lungs. Ventricular tachycardia may lead to a condition in which your lower heart chambers quiver (ventricular fibrillation), which may cause your heart to stop (cardiac arrest) and lead to death if not treated immediately.</p>



BONE-AND-JOINT-INFECTIONS
definition


<p>Septic arthritis is an intensely painful infection in a joint. The joint can become infected with germs that travel through your bloodstream from another part of your body. Septic arthritis can also occur when a penetrating injury brings germs directly into the joint. </p>
<p>Infants and older adults are most likely to develop septic arthritis. The most common joints affected are the knees and hips. Septic arthritis can quickly and severely damage the cartilage and bone within the joint, so prompt treatment is crucial. </p>
<p>Treatment involves draining the joint with a needle or via an operation. Intravenous antibiotics also may be necessary to stop the infection. </p>

TRUNCUS-ARTERIOSUS
definition


<p>Truncus arteriosus (TRUNG-kus ahr-teer-e-O-sus) is a rare heart defect that's present at birth (congenital). If your baby has truncus arteriosus, it means that one large blood vessel leads out of the heart. Normally, there are two separate vessels coming out of the heart. </p>
<p>In addition, the two lower chambers of the heart are missing a portion of the wall that divides them. As a result of truncus arteriosus, oxygen-poor blood that should go to the lungs and oxygen-rich blood that should go to the rest of the body are mixed together. This creates severe circulatory problems. </p>
<p>If left untreated, truncus arteriosus can be fatal. Surgery to repair truncus arteriosus is generally successful, especially if the repair occurs before your baby is 2 months old. </p>



HISTOPLASMOSIS
definition


<p>Histoplasmosis is an infection caused by breathing in spores of a fungus often found in bird and bat droppings. Histoplasmosis is most commonly transmitted when these spores become airborne, often during cleanup or demolition projects. </p>
<p>Soil contaminated by bird or bat droppings also can transmit histoplasmosis, so farmers and landscapers are at a higher risk of the disease. In the United States, histoplasmosis most commonly occurs in the Mississippi and Ohio river valleys. </p>
<p>Most people with histoplasmosis never develop symptoms and aren't aware they're infected. But for some people &mdash; primarily infants and those with compromised immune systems &mdash; histoplasmosis can be serious. Effective treatments are available for even the most severe forms of histoplasmosis. </p>



BROKEN-HEART-SYNDROME
definition


<p>Broken heart syndrome is a temporary heart condition that's often brought on by stressful situations, such as the death of a loved one. People with broken heart syndrome may have sudden chest pain or think they're having a heart attack. In broken heart syndrome, there's a temporary disruption of your heart's normal pumping function, while the remainder of the heart functions normally or with even more forceful contractions.</p>
<p>Broken heart syndrome may be caused by the heart's reaction to a surge of stress hormones. The condition may also be called takotsubo cardiomyopathy, apical ballooning syndrome or stress cardiomyopathy by doctors.</p>
<p>The symptoms of broken heart syndrome are treatable, and the condition usually reverses itself in about a week.</p>



POSTPARTUM-THYROIDITIS
definition


<p>Postpartum thyroiditis is an uncommon condition in which a previously normal-functioning thyroid gland &mdash; a butterfly-shaped gland located at the base of your neck just below your Adam's apple &mdash; becomes inflamed within the first year after childbirth. </p>
<p>Postpartum thyroiditis often lasts several weeks to several months. However, postpartum thyroiditis can be difficult to recognize because its symptoms are often mistakenly attributed to the stress of having a newborn and postpartum mood disorders. </p>
<p>For most women who develop postpartum thyroiditis, thyroid function returns to normal within 12 to 18 months of the start of symptoms. However, some women who experience postpartum thyroiditis develop permanent complications. </p>

GANGRENE
definition


<p>Gangrene refers to the death of body tissue due to a lack of blood flow or a bacterial infection. Gangrene most commonly affects the extremities, including your toes, fingers and limbs, but it can also occur in your muscles and internal organs. </p>
<p>Your chances of developing gangrene are higher if you have an underlying condition that can damage your blood vessels and affect blood flow, such as diabetes or atherosclerosis. </p>
<p>Treatments for gangrene include surgery to remove dead tissue, antibiotics and other approaches. The prognosis for recovery is better if gangrene is identified early and treated quickly. </p>



HEMOLYTIC-UREMIC-SYNDROME
definition


<p>Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) is a condition that results from the abnormal premature destruction of red blood cells. Once this process begins, the damaged red blood cells start to clog the filtering system in the kidneys, which may eventually cause the life-threatening kidney failure associated with hemolytic uremic syndrome. </p>
<p>Most cases of hemolytic uremic syndrome develop in children after two to 14 days of diarrhea &mdash; often bloody &mdash; due to infection with a certain strain of Escherichia coli (E. coli). Adults also may develop hemolytic uremic syndrome after an E. coli infection, but the cause also may be certain medications, other types of infections, pregnancy or it may be unknown. </p>
<p>Though hemolytic uremic syndrome is a serious condition, getting timely and appropriate treatment leads to a full recovery for most people &mdash; especially young children. </p>



HPV-INFECTION
definition


<p>HPV infection causes warts. More than 100 varieties of human papillomavirus (HPV) exist. Different types of HPV infection can cause warts on different parts of your body. For example, some types of HPV infection cause plantar warts on the feet, while other varieties of HPV infection are responsible for the warts that most commonly occur on the hands or face. </p>
<p>There are more than 40 different strains of HPV that specifically affect the genital area. Most HPV infections don't lead to cancer, but some types of genital HPV can cause cancer of the cervix &mdash; the passage between the vagina and the uterus. Vaccines can help protect against the strains of genital HPV most likely to cause genital warts or cervical cancer. </p>



WEGENERS-GRANULOMATOSIS
definition


<p>Wegener's granulomatosis (VEG-eh-nerz gran-u-loe-muh-TOE-sis) is an uncommon disorder that causes inflammation of your blood vessels. This inflammation restricts blood flow to various organs. </p>
<p>Wegener's granulomatosis, which is also called granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), often affects your kidneys, lungs and upper respiratory tract. The restricted blood flow to these organs can damage them. Wegener's can affect other organs, but this isn't as common, and generally isn't as serious. </p>
<p>Wegener's granulomatosis also produces a type of inflammatory tissue known as a granuloma that's found around the blood vessels. Granulomas can destroy normal tissue. There is no known cause for Wegener's granulomatosis. </p>
<p>Early diagnosis and treatment of Wegener's granulomatosis may lead to a full recovery. Without treatment, Wegener's granulomatosis can be fatal, most commonly from kidney failure. </p>



BAD-BREATH
definition


<p>Bad breath, also called halitosis, can be embarrassing and in some cases may even cause anxiety. It's no wonder that store shelves are overflowing with gum, mints, mouthwashes and other products designed to fight bad breath. But many of these products are only temporary measures because they don't address the cause of the problem. </p>
<p>Certain foods, health conditions and habits are among the causes of bad breath. In many cases, you can improve bad breath with consistent proper dental hygiene. If simple self-care techniques don't solve the problem, see your dentist or physician to be sure a more serious condition isn't causing your bad breath. </p>

NOONAN-SYNDROME
definition


<p>Noonan syndrome is a genetic disorder that prevents normal development in various parts of the body. A person can be affected by Noonan syndrome in various ways. These include unusual facial characteristics, short stature, heart defects, other physical problems and possible developmental delays. </p>
<p>Noonan syndrome is caused by a genetic mutation and is acquired when a child inherits a copy of an affected gene from a parent (dominant inheritance). It can also occur as a spontaneous mutation, meaning there's no family history involved. </p>
<p>There's no specific treatment for Noonan syndrome. Management focuses on controlling the disease's symptoms and complications. Growth hormone may be used to treat short stature in some people with Noonan syndrome. </p>



METACHROMATIC-LEUKODYSTROPHY
definition


<p>In metachromatic leukodystrophy, a rare hereditary (genetic) disorder, deficiency of an enzyme that helps break down fatty substances (lipids) causes lipids to build up in your brain, spinal cord and peripheral nerves. As a result, your brain and nervous system progressively lose function.</p>
<p>Rarely, a deficient nonenzyme protein (activator protein) causes metachromatic leukodystrophy.</p>
<p>You or your child may have one of three types of metachromatic leukodystrophy. Each type occurs at different ages and has different signs and symptoms.</p>
<p>The types, which may overlap, include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Infantile form, occurring between ages 6 months and 2 years</li>
    <li>Juvenile form, occurring between ages 3 and 6 (early juvenile) or between ages 6 and 16 (late juvenile)</li>
    <li>Adult form, occurring at age 17 or older</li>
</ul>



SEROTONIN-SYNDROME
definition


<p>Serotonin syndrome occurs when you take medications that cause high levels of the chemical serotonin to accumulate in your body.</p>
<p>Serotonin syndrome can occur when you increase the dose of such a drug or add a new drug to your regimen. Certain illegal drugs and dietary supplements also are associated with serotonin syndrome.</p>
<p>Serotonin is a chemical your body produces that's needed for your nerve cells and brain to function. But too much serotonin causes symptoms that can range from mild (shivering and diarrhea) to severe (muscle rigidity, fever and seizures). Severe serotonin syndrome can be fatal if not treated.</p>
<p>Milder forms of serotonin syndrome may go away within a day of stopping the medications that cause symptoms and, sometimes, taking drugs that block serotonin.</p>



COMPLEX-REGIONAL-PAIN-SYNDROME
definition


<p>Complex regional pain syndrome is an uncommon form of chronic pain that usually affects an arm or a leg. Complex regional pain syndrome typically develops after an injury, surgery, stroke or heart attack, but the pain is out of proportion to the severity of the initial injury.</p>
<p>The cause of complex regional pain syndrome isn't clearly understood. Treatment for complex regional pain syndrome is most effective when started early. In such cases, improvement and even remission are possible.</p>

definition


<p>A hamstring injury occurs when you strain or pull one of your hamstring muscles &mdash; the group of three muscles that run along the back of your thigh. </p>
<p>You may be more likely to get a hamstring injury if you play soccer, basketball, football, tennis or a similar sport that involves sprinting with sudden stops and starts. Hamstring injury can occur in runners and in dancers as well. </p>
<p>Self-care measures such as rest, ice and over-the-counter pain medications are often all you need to relieve the pain and swelling associated with a hamstring injury. Rarely, surgery may be needed to repair a torn muscle. </p>



PULMONARY-EDEMA
definition


<p>Pulmonary edema is a condition caused by excess fluid in the lungs. This fluid collects in the numerous air sacs in the lungs, making it difficult to breathe.</p>
<p>In most cases, heart problems cause pulmonary edema. But fluid can accumulate for other reasons, including pneumonia, exposure to certain toxins and medications, trauma to the chest wall, and exercising or living at high elevations.</p>
<p>Pulmonary edema that develops suddenly (acute pulmonary edema) is a medical emergency requiring immediate care. Although pulmonary edema can sometimes prove fatal, the outlook improves when you receive prompt treatment for pulmonary edema along with treatment for the underlying problem. Treatment for pulmonary edema varies depending on the cause but generally includes supplemental oxygen and medications.</p>

THROMBOCYTOPENIA
definition


<p>Thrombocytopenia is the medical term for a low blood platelet count. Platelets (thrombocytes) are colorless blood cells that play an important role in blood clotting. Platelets stop blood loss by clumping and forming plugs in blood vessel holes. </p>
<p>Thrombocytopenia often occurs as a result of a separate disorder, such as leukemia or an immune system problem, or as a medication side effect. Thrombocytopenia may be mild and cause few signs or symptoms. In rare cases, the number of platelets may be so low that dangerous internal bleeding can occur. </p>
<p>Thrombocytopenia usually improves when the underlying cause is treated. Sometimes medications, surgery or a blood transfusion can help treat chronic thrombocytopenia. </p>

PROGERIA
definition


<p>Progeria (pro-JEER-e-uh), also known as Hutchinson-Gilford syndrome, is an extremely rare, progressive genetic disorder that causes children to age rapidly, beginning in their first two years of life.</p>
<p>Children with progeria generally appear normal at birth. During the first year, signs and symptoms, such as slow growth and hair loss, begin to appear.</p>
<p>Heart problems or strokes are the eventual cause of death in most children with progeria. The average life expectancy for a child with progeria is about 13 years, but some with the disease die younger and some live 20 years or longer.</p>
<p>There's no cure for progeria, but ongoing research shows some promise for treatment.</p>



LUPUS-NEPHRITIS
definition


<p>Systemic lupus erythematosus &mdash; more commonly known as lupus &mdash; is an autoimmune disease in which your immune system produces proteins called autoantibodies that attack your own tissues and organs. Some people with lupus develop a form of kidney inflammation called lupus nephritis.</p>
<p>Lupus nephritis occurs when lupus autoantibodies affect the filtering structures (glomeruli) of your kidneys. This abnormal process results in kidney inflammation and may lead to blood in the urine (hematuria), protein in the urine (proteinuria), high blood pressure, impaired kidney function or even kidney failure.</p>



HURTHLE-CELL-CANCER
definition


<p>Hurthle (HEERT-luh) cell cancer is a rare form of cancer affecting the butterfly-shaped thyroid gland in the front part of the lower neck. The thyroid secretes hormones that are essential for regulating your body's metabolism. </p>
<p>Hurthle cell cancer is also called Hurthle cell carcinoma or oxyphilic cell carcinoma. Hurthle cell cancer is one of several types of cancer that affect the thyroid. </p>
<p>Hurthle cell cancer can be more aggressive than other types of thyroid cancer. Surgery to remove the thyroid gland is the most common treatment for Hurthle cell cancer. </p>



MENTAL-ILLNESS
definition


<p>Mental illness refers to a wide range of mental health conditions &mdash; disorders that affect your mood, thinking and behavior. Examples of mental illness include depression, anxiety disorders, schizophrenia, eating disorders and addictive behaviors.</p>
<p>Many people have mental health concerns from time to time. But a mental health concern becomes a mental illness when ongoing signs and symptoms cause frequent stress and affect your ability to function.</p>
<p>A mental illness can make you miserable and can cause problems in your daily life, such as at work or in relationships. In most cases, symptoms can be managed with a combination of medications and counseling (psychotherapy).</p>



GERM-CELL-TUMORS
definition


<p>Germ cell tumors are growths that form from reproductive cells. Tumors may be cancerous or noncancerous. Most germ cell tumors that are cancerous occur as cancer of the testicles in males (<a href="http://www.mayoclinic.org/testicular-cancer/">testicular cancer</a>) or cancer of the ovaries in females (<a href="http://www.mayoclinic.org/ovarian-cancer/">ovarian cancer</a>).</p>
<p>Some germ cell tumors occur in other areas of the body, such as the abdomen, brain and chest, though it's not clear why. Germ cell tumors that occur in places other than the testicles and ovaries (extragonadal germ cell tumors) are very rare.</p>
<p>Germ cell tumors tend to respond to treatment and many can be cured, even when diagnosed at a late stage.</p>



COMMON-VARIABLE-IMMUNODEFICIENCY
definition


<p>Common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) is an immune system disorder in which you have low levels of several of the proteins (antibodies) that help you fight infections. CVID leaves you open to recurrent infections in your ears, sinuses and respiratory system, and increases your risk of digestive disorders, blood disorders and cancer.</p>
<p>Signs and symptoms of common variable immunodeficiency may appear during childhood or adolescence, though most people don't experience them until adulthood. The condition can be inherited, or it can be acquired during your lifetime.</p>



ACHALASIA
definition


<p>Achalasia is a rare disorder that makes it difficult for food and liquid to pass into your stomach. Achalasia occurs when the food tube (esophagus) loses the ability to squeeze food down, and the muscular valve between the esophagus and stomach doesn't fully relax. The reason for these problems is damage to the nerves in the esophagus. There's no cure, but achalasia symptoms can usually be managed with minimally invasive (endoscopic) therapy or surgery.</p>



HYPERTHYROIDISM
definition


<p>Hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid) is a condition in which your thyroid gland produces too much of the hormone thyroxine. Hyperthyroidism can accelerate your body's metabolism significantly, causing sudden weight loss, a rapid or irregular heartbeat, sweating, and nervousness or irritability. </p>
<p>Several treatment options are available if you have hyperthyroidism. Doctors use anti-thyroid medications and radioactive iodine to slow the production of thyroid hormones. Sometimes, treatment of hyperthyroidism involves surgery to remove all or part of your thyroid gland. Although hyperthyroidism can be serious if you ignore it, most people respond well once hyperthyroidism is diagnosed and treated. </p>

POUCHITIS
definition


<p>Many people with serious ulcerative colitis end up having their diseased colon removed and the bowel reconnected with a surgical procedure known as <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.org/ileoanal-anastomosis/">ileoanal anastomosis (IPAA)</a> . This surgery creates an internal pouch (from the small intestine) to hold waste before it's eliminated. Pouchitis is an inflammation of the lining of this pouch. This complication occurs in up to half of people who have this operation. They experience symptoms such as abdominal pain, cramps, increased number of bowel movements and a strong feeling of the need to have a bowel movement.</p>

TEEN-DEPRESSION
definition


<p>Teen depression is a serious medical problem that causes a persistent feeling of sadness and loss of interest in activities. It affects how your teen thinks, feels and behaves, and it can cause emotional, functional and physical problems. Although mood disorders, such as depression, can occur at any time in life, symptoms may be different between teens and adults. </p>
<p>Issues such as peer pressure, academic expectations and changing bodies can bring a lot of ups and downs for teens. But for some teens, the lows are more than just temporary feelings &mdash; they're a symptom of depression. </p>
<p>Teen depression isn't a weakness or something that can be overcome with willpower &mdash; it can have serious consequences and requires long-term treatment. For most teens, depression symptoms ease with treatment such as medication and psychological counseling. </p>



VULVODYNIA
definition


<p>Vulvodynia (vul-voe-DIN-e-uh) is chronic pain in the area around the opening of your vagina (vulva) for which there is no identifiable cause. The pain, burning or irritation associated with vulvodynia may make you so uncomfortable that sitting for long periods or having sex becomes unthinkable. The condition can go on for months or years.</p>
<p>If you have vulvodynia, don't let the absence of visible signs or embarrassment about discussing the symptoms keep you from seeking help. Treatment options are available to lessen your pain and discomfort.</p>



ACUTE-SINUSITIS
definition


<p>Acute sinusitis (acute rhinosinusitis) causes the cavities around your nasal passages (sinuses) to become inflamed and swollen. This interferes with drainage and causes mucus to build up. </p>
<p>With acute sinusitis, it may be difficult to breathe through your nose. The area around your eyes and face may feel swollen, and you may have throbbing facial pain or a headache. </p>
<p>Acute sinusitis is most often caused by the common cold. Other triggers include allergies, bacterial and fungal infections. Treatment of acute sinusitis depends on the cause. In most cases, home remedies are all that's needed. However, persistent sinusitis can lead to serious infections and other complications. Sinusitis that lasts more than eight weeks or keeps coming back is called chronic sinusitis. </p>



BILE-REFLUX
definition


<p>Bile reflux occurs when bile &mdash; a digestive liquid produced in your liver &mdash; backs up (refluxes) into your stomach and esophagus (the tube that connects your mouth and stomach). Bile reflux may accompany acid reflux, the medical term for the backwash of stomach acids into your esophagus. </p>
<p>Whether bile is important in reflux is controversial. Bile is often implicated as a cause of reflux when people respond incompletely or not at all to powerful acid-suppressant medications. But there is little evidence pinpointing the effects of bile reflux in people. Studies in lab animals indicate that over time, bile reflux may have serious consequences, potentially increasing your risk of esophageal cancer. </p>
<p>Unlike acid reflux, bile reflux usually can't be completely controlled by changes in diet or lifestyle. Instead, bile reflux is most often managed with medications or, in severe cases, with surgery. </p>



SCROTAL-MASSES
definition


<p>Scrotal masses are abnormalities in the contents of the scrotum, the bag of skin hanging behind the penis. The scrotum contains the testicles and related structures that produce, store and transport sperm and male sex hormones.</p>
<p>Scrotal masses might be an accumulation of fluids, the growth of abnormal tissue, or normal contents of the scrotum that have become swollen, inflamed or hardened.</p>
<p>Scrotal masses need to be examined by a doctor, even if you're not in pain or having other symptoms. Scrotal masses could be cancerous or caused by another condition that affects testicular function and health.</p>
<p>Self-examination and regular doctor exams of the scrotum are important for prompt recognition, diagnosis and treatment of scrotal masses.</p>

FETAL-ALCOHOL-SYNDROME
definition


<p>Fetal alcohol syndrome is a condition in a child that results from alcohol exposure during the mother's pregnancy. Fetal alcohol syndrome causes brain damage and growth problems. The problems caused by fetal alcohol syndrome vary from child to child, but defects caused by fetal alcohol syndrome are irreversible.</p>
<p>There is no amount of alcohol that's known to be safe to consume during pregnancy. If you drink during pregnancy, you place your baby at risk of fetal alcohol syndrome.</p>
<p>If you suspect your child has fetal alcohol syndrome, talk to your doctor as soon as possible. Early diagnosis may reduce the risk of problems such as learning difficulties and behavior issues.</p>



AMELOBLASTOMA
definition


<p>Ameloblastoma is a rare, noncancerous (benign) tumor that develops most often in the jaw near the molars. Ameloblastoma begins in the cells that form the protective enamel lining on your teeth.</p>
<p>Ameloblastoma occurs in men more often than it occurs in women. Though it can be diagnosed at any age, ameloblastoma is most often diagnosed in adults in their 40s or 50s.</p>
<p>Despite being benign, ameloblastoma can be very aggressive, growing into the jawbone and causing swelling and pain. Very rarely, ameloblastoma cells can spread to other areas of the body, such as the lymph nodes in the neck and the lungs.</p>
<p>Ameloblastoma is the most common type of <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.org/odontogenic-lesions/">odontogenic lesion</a>.</p>



Q-FEVER
definition


<p>Q fever is an infection caused by the bacterium Coxiella burnetii. Q fever is usually a mild disease with flu-like symptoms. Many people have no symptoms at all. In a small percentage of people, the infection can resurface years later. This more deadly form of Q fever can damage your heart, liver, brain and lungs.</p>
<p>Q fever is transmitted to humans by animals, most commonly sheep, goats and cattle. When you inhale barnyard dust particles contaminated by infected animals, you may become infected. High-risk occupations include farming, veterinary medicine and animal research.</p>
<p>Mild cases of Q fever clear up quickly with antibiotic treatment. But if Q fever recurs, you may need to take antibiotics for at least 18 months.</p>

TRACHOMA
definition


<p>Trachoma (truh-KOH-muh) is a bacterial infection that affects your eyes. The bacterium that causes trachoma spreads through direct contact with the eyes, eyelids, and nose or throat secretions of infected people. </p>
<p>Trachoma is very contagious and almost always affects both eyes. Signs and symptoms of trachoma begin with mild itching and irritation of your eyes and eyelids and lead to blurred vision and eye pain. Untreated trachoma can lead to blindness. </p>
<p>Trachoma is the leading preventable cause of blindness worldwide. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 8 million people worldwide have been visually impaired by trachoma. WHO estimates more than 84 million people need treatment for trachoma, primarily in poor areas of developing countries. In some of the poorest countries in Africa, prevalence among children can reach 40 percent. </p>
<p>If trachoma is treated early, it often may prevent further trachoma complications. </p>



PREMATURE-VENTRICULAR-CONTRACTIONS
definition


<p>Premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) are extra, abnormal heartbeats that begin in one of your heart's two lower pumping chambers (ventricles). These extra beats disrupt your regular heart rhythm, sometimes causing you to feel a flip-flop or skipped beat in your chest. Premature ventricular contractions are very common &mdash; they occur in most people at some point. </p>
<p>Premature ventricular contractions are also called:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Premature ventricular complexes</li>
    <li>PVCs</li>
    <li>Ventricular premature beats</li>
    <li>Extrasystoles</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have occasional premature ventricular contractions, but you're an otherwise healthy person, there's generally no reason for concern, and no treatment is needed.&nbsp;If you have frequent premature ventricular contractions or underlying heart disease, you may need treatment to help you feel better and treat underlying heart problems.</p>

ANORGASMIA
definition


<p>Anorgasmia is the medical term for regular difficulty reaching orgasm after ample sexual stimulation, causing you personal distress. Anorgasmia is actually a common occurrence, affecting more women than you might think. </p>
<p>Orgasms vary in intensity, and women vary in the frequency of their orgasms and the amount of stimulation necessary to trigger an orgasm. In fact, fewer than a third of women consistently have orgasms with sexual activity. Plus, orgasms often change with age, medical issues or medications you're taking. </p>
<p>If you're happy with the climax of your sexual activities, there's no need for concern. However, if you're bothered by lack of orgasm or the intensity of your orgasms, talk to your doctor about anorgasmia. Lifestyle changes and sex therapy may help. </p>

CHILBLAINS
definition


<p>Chilblains (CHILL-blayns) are the painful inflammation of small blood vessels in your skin that occur in response to sudden warming from cold temperatures. Also known as pernio, chilblains can cause itching, red patches, swelling and blistering on extremities, such as on your toes, fingers, ears and nose. </p>
<p>Chilblains may get better on its own, especially as the weather gets warmer. Chilblains usually clear up within one to three weeks, though they may recur seasonally for years. Treatments typically consist of lotions and medication. While Chilblains don't usually result in permanent injury, they can lead to infection, which may cause severe damage if left untreated. </p>
<p>The best approach to chilblains is to avoid developing them by limiting your exposure to cold, dressing warmly and covering exposed skin. </p>



GONORRHEA
definition


<p>Gonorrhea is an infection caused by a sexually transmitted bacterium that can infect both males and females. Gonorrhea most often affects the urethra, rectum or throat. In females, gonorrhea can also infect the cervix.</p>
<p>Gonorrhea is most commonly spread during sex. But babies can be infected during childbirth if their mothers are infected. In babies, gonorrhea most commonly affects the eyes.</p>
<p>Gonorrhea is a common infection that, in many cases, causes no symptoms. You may not even know that you're infected. Abstaining from sex, using a condom if you do have sex and being in a mutually monogamous relationship are the best ways to prevent sexually transmitted infections.</p>



SWEETS-SYNDROME

ASTHMA-ATTACK
definition


<p>During an asthma attack, also called an asthma exacerbation, your airways become swollen and inflamed. The muscles around the airways contract, causing your breathing (bronchial) tubes to narrow.</p>
<p>During an asthma attack, you may cough, wheeze and have trouble breathing. An asthma attack may be minor, with symptoms that get better with prompt home treatment, or it may be more serious. A severe asthma attack that doesn't improve with home treatment can become a life-threatening emergency.</p>
<p>The key to stopping an asthma attack is recognizing and treating an asthma flare-up early. Follow the treatment plan you worked out with your doctor ahead of time. This plan should include what to do when your asthma starts getting worse, and how to deal with an asthma attack in progress.</p>



NEPHROGENIC-SYSTEMIC-FIBROSIS
definition


<p>Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis is a rare disease that occurs mainly in people with advanced acute kidney failure or those who are receiving dialysis. The disease causes extensive patches of thickened and hardened skin. Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis can also affect internal organs, such as the heart, kidneys and lungs, and it can cause a disabling shortening of muscles and tendons in the joints (joint contracture).</p>
<p>For some people with advanced kidney disease, being exposed to gadolinium-containing contrast agents during magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been identified as a trigger for development of this disease. Recognition of this link has dramatically reduced the incidence of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis.</p>

NIGHT-TERRORS
definition


<p>Sleep terrors are episodes of screaming, intense fear and flailing while still asleep. Also known as night terrors, sleep terrors often are paired with sleepwalking. Like sleepwalking, sleep terrors are considered a parasomnia &mdash; an undesired occurrence during sleep.</p>
<p>Although sleep terrors are more common in children, they can also affect adults. A sleep terror episode usually lasts from seconds to a few minutes, but they may last longer.</p>
<p>Sleep terrors are relatively rare, affecting only a small percentage of children &mdash; often between ages 4 and 12 &mdash; and a smaller percentage of adults. However frightening, sleep terrors aren't usually a cause for concern. Most children outgrow sleep terrors by their teenage years.</p>
<p>Sleep terrors may require treatment if they cause problems getting enough sleep or they pose a safety risk.</p>



HEMIFACIAL-SPASM
definition


<p>Hemifacial spasm is a nervous system disorder in which the muscles on one side of your face twitch involuntarily. Hemifacial spasm may be caused by a blood vessel touching a facial nerve, a facial nerve injury or a tumor, or it may not have a cause.</p>



DANDRUFF
definition


<p>Dandruff is a common chronic scalp condition marked by flaking of the skin on your scalp. Although dandruff isn't contagious and is rarely serious, it can be embarrassing and sometimes difficult to treat.</p>
<p>The good news is that dandruff usually can be controlled. Mild cases of dandruff may need nothing more than daily shampooing with a gentle cleanser. More stubborn cases of dandruff often respond to medicated shampoos.</p>



ADULT-STILLS-DISEASE
definition


<p>Adult Still's disease is a rare type of arthritis that features a sore throat, a salmon-colored rash and a high fever that spikes once or twice a day. Joint pain tends to develop a few weeks after these initial signs and symptoms. </p>
<p>The cause of adult Still's disease is unknown, but researchers are investigating the possibility that it might be triggered by some type of infection. Some people experience just one episode of adult Still's disease. In other people, the condition persists or recurs. </p>
<p>Adult Still's disease is an inflammatory type of arthritis, similar to rheumatoid arthritis. This inflammation can destroy affected joints, particularly the wrists. Treatment involves medications, such as prednisone, that help control inflammation. </p>



TRIPLE-X-SYNDROME
definition


<p>Triple X syndrome is an abnormality of the chromosomes that affects about 1 in 1,000 females. Females normally have two X chromosomes, one from each parent. In triple X syndrome, a female has three X chromosomes &mdash; hence, the name. </p>
<p>Triple X syndrome usually results from an error in the formation of a mother's egg cell or a father's sperm cell. Sometimes, triple X syndrome occurs as a result of an error early in the embryo's development. </p>
<p>Many girls and women with triple X syndrome have no symptoms or only mild symptoms. In other cases, symptoms may be more pronounced &mdash; possibly including developmental delays. </p>
<p>Treatment for triple X syndrome depends on which symptoms, if any, your daughter exhibits and their severity. </p>



MALE-HYPOGONADISM
definition


<p>Male hypogonadism is a condition in which the body doesn't produce enough testosterone &mdash; the hormone that plays a key role in masculine growth and development during puberty &mdash; or has an impaired ability to produce sperm or both.</p>
<p>You may be born with male hypogonadism, or it can develop later in life from injury or infection. The effects &mdash; and what you can do about them &mdash; depend on the cause and at what point in your life male hypogonadism occurs. Some types of male hypogonadism can be treated with testosterone replacement therapy.</p>



ACNE
definition


<p>Acne is a skin condition that occurs when your hair follicles become plugged with oil and dead skin cells. Acne most commonly appears on your face, neck, chest, back and shoulders. Acne can be distressing and annoyingly persistent. Acne lesions heal slowly, and when one begins to resolve, others seem to crop up. </p>
<p>Depending on its severity, acne can cause emotional distress and lead to scarring of the skin. The good news is that effective treatments are available &mdash; and the earlier treatment is started, the lower your risk of lasting physical and emotional damage. </p>



OCD
definition


<p>Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is characterized by unreasonable thoughts and fears (obsessions) that lead you to do repetitive behaviors (compulsions). It's also possible to have only obsessions or only compulsions and still have OCD.</p>
<p>With OCD, you may or may not realize that your obsessions aren't reasonable, and you may try to ignore them or stop them. But that only increases your distress and anxiety. Ultimately, you feel driven to perform compulsive acts in an effort to ease your stressful feelings.</p>
<p>OCD often centers around themes, such as a fear of getting contaminated by germs. To ease your contamination fears, you may compulsively wash your hands until they're sore and chapped. Despite efforts to ignore or get rid of bothersome thoughts, the thoughts or urges keep coming back. This leads to more ritualistic behavior &mdash; and a vicious cycle that's characteristic of OCD.</p>

CARBON-MONOXIDE
definition


<p>Carbon monoxide poisoning is an illness caused by exposure to too much carbon monoxide &mdash; a colorless, odorless and tasteless gas. Too much carbon monoxide in the air you breathe can greatly diminish your ability to absorb oxygen, leading to serious tissue damage. Carbon monoxide poisoning can lead to death. </p>
<p>Carbon monoxide is produced by appliances and other devices that generate combustion fumes, such as those that burn gas or other petroleum products, wood and other fuels. The danger occurs when too much carbon monoxide accumulates in a contained, poorly ventilated space. </p>
<p>Although the signs of carbon monoxide poisoning can be subtle, the condition is a life-threatening medical emergency. Get immediate care for anyone who may have carbon monoxide poisoning. </p>



LEAD-POISONING
definition


<p>Lead poisoning occurs when lead builds up in the body, often over a period of months or years. Even small amounts of lead can cause serious health problems. Children under the age of 6 are especially vulnerable to lead poisoning, which can severely affect mental and physical development. At very high levels, lead poisoning can be fatal.</p>
<p>Lead-based paint and lead-contaminated dust in older buildings are the most common sources of lead poisoning in children. Other sources include contaminated air, water and soil. Adults who work with batteries, do home renovations or work in auto repair shops also may be exposed to lead.</p>
<p>While treatment is available for lead poisoning, taking some simple precautions can help protect yourself and your family.</p>



VON-WILLEBRAND-DISEASE
definition


<p>Von Willebrand disease is a condition that can cause extended or excessive bleeding. The condition is most often inherited but in rare cases may develop later in life.</p>
<p>The cause of von Willebrand disease is a deficiency in or impairment of a protein called von Willebrand factor, an important component in your blood-clotting process. In general, it takes longer for people with von Willebrand disease to form clots and stop bleeding when they're cut.</p>
<p>Treatment of von Willebrand disease focuses on stopping or preventing bleeding episodes, typically by using medications. With the right treatment, most people with von Willebrand disease can lead relatively normal, healthy lives.</p>



MUSCLE-CRAMP
definition


<p>A muscle cramp is a sudden and involuntary contraction of one or more of your muscles. If you've ever been awakened in the night or stopped in your tracks by a sudden charley horse, you know that muscle cramps can cause excruciating pain. Though generally harmless, muscle cramps can make it temporarily impossible to use the affected muscle. </p>
<p>Long periods of exercise or physical labor, particularly in hot weather, may lead to muscle cramps. Some medications and certain medical conditions also may cause muscle cramps. You can usually treat muscle cramps at home with self-care measures. </p>



SPINAL-CORD-INJURY
definition


<p>A spinal cord injury &mdash; damage to any part of the spinal cord or nerves at the end of the spinal canal &mdash; often causes permanent changes in strength, sensation and other body functions below the site of the injury. If you've recently experienced a spinal cord injury, it might seem like every aspect of your life will be affected. </p>
<p>Many scientists are optimistic that advances in research will someday make the repair of spinal cord injuries possible. Research studies are ongoing around the world. In the meantime, treatments and rehabilitation allow many people with a spinal cord injury to lead productive, independent lives. </p>



PERIPHERAL-NERVE-TUMORS
definition


<p>Peripheral nerve tumors are masses that occur on or near the network of nerves (peripheral nerves) that link the brain and spinal cord to other parts of the body. Peripheral nerve tumors may occur anywhere in the body and may affect the function of the peripheral nerves.</p>
<p>Peripheral nerve tumors may be noncancerous (<a href="/diseases-conditions/peripheral-nerve-tumors-benign/basics/definition/con-20036199">benign peripheral nerve tumors</a>) or cancerous (<a href="/diseases-conditions/malignant-peripheral-nerve-sheath-tumors/basics/definition/con-20035841">malignant peripheral nerve tumors</a>), though most are benign.

ALCOHOLISM
definition


<p>Alcoholism is a chronic and often progressive disease that includes problems controlling your drinking, being preoccupied with alcohol, continuing to use alcohol even when it causes problems, having to drink more to get the same effect (physical dependence), or having withdrawal symptoms when you rapidly decrease or stop drinking. If you have alcoholism, you can't consistently predict how much you'll drink, how long you'll drink, or what consequences will occur from your drinking. </p>
<p>It's possible to have a problem with alcohol, even when it has not progressed to the point of alcoholism. Problem drinking means you drink too much at times, causing repeated problems in your life, although you're not completely dependent on alcohol. </p>
<p>Binge drinking &mdash; a pattern of drinking where a male consumes five or more drinks in a row, or a female downs at least four drinks in a row &mdash; can lead to the same health risks and social problems associated with alcoholism. The more you drink, the greater the risks. Binge drinking, which often occurs with teenagers and young adults, may lead to faster development of alcoholism. </p>
<p>If you have alcoholism or you have a problem with alcohol, you may not be able to cut back or quit without help. Denying that you have a problem is usually part of alcoholism and other types of excessive drinking. </p>

ASPERGILLOSIS
definition


<p>Aspergillosis is an infection caused by a type of mold. The illnesses resulting from aspergillosis infection usually affect the respiratory system, but their signs and severity vary greatly. The mold that triggers the illnesses, aspergillus, is everywhere, indoors and outdoors. Most strains of this mold are harmless, but a few can cause serious illnesses when people with weakened immune systems, underlying lung disease or asthma inhale their spores.</p>
<p>In some people, the spores trigger an allergic reaction. Other people develop mild to serious lung infections. The most serious form of aspergillosis &mdash; invasive aspergillosis &mdash; occurs when the infection spreads to blood vessels and beyond.</p>
<p>Depending on the type of aspergillosis, treatment may involve observation, antifungal medications or, in rare cases, surgery.</p>



THYROID-NODULES
definition


<p>Thyroid nodules are solid or fluid-filled lumps that form within your thyroid, a small gland located at the base of your neck, just above your breastbone.</p>
<p>The great majority of thyroid nodules aren't serious and don't cause symptoms. Thyroid cancer accounts for only a small percentage of thyroid nodules.</p>
<p>You often won't know you have a thyroid nodule until your doctor discovers it during a routine medical exam. Some thyroid nodules, however, may become large enough to be visible or make it difficult to swallow or breathe.</p>
<p>Treatment options depend on the type of thyroid nodule you have.</p>

<p>An amniotic fluid embolism is a rare but serious condition that occurs when amniotic fluid &mdash; the fluid that surrounds a baby in the uterus during pregnancy &mdash; or fetal material, such as hair, enters the maternal bloodstream. </p>
<p>An amniotic fluid embolism is most likely to occur during childbirth or immediately afterward. </p>
<p>An amniotic fluid embolism is difficult to diagnose. If your doctor suspects you might have an amniotic fluid embolism, you'll need immediate treatment to prevent potentially life-threatening complications. </p>

ASTIGMATISM
definition


<p>Astigmatism (uh-STIG-muh-tiz-um) is a common, mild and generally easily treatable imperfection in the curvature of your eye. The condition can cause blurred vision.</p>
<p>Astigmatism occurs when the front surface of your eye (cornea) or the lens, inside your eye, has a slightly different surface curvature in one direction from the other. Instead of being even and smooth in all directions, the surface may have some areas that are flatter or steeper.</p>
<p>Astigmatism blurs your vision at all distances. Astigmatism is often present at birth and may occur in combination with nearsightedness or farsightedness. Often it's not pronounced enough to require corrective action. When it is, your treatment options include corrective lenses and surgery.</p>



CHOLERA
definition


<p>Cholera is a bacterial disease usually spread through contaminated water. Cholera causes severe diarrhea and dehydration. Left untreated, cholera can be fatal in a matter of hours, even in previously healthy people.</p>
<p>Modern sewage and water treatment have virtually eliminated cholera in industrialized countries. The last major outbreak in the United States occurred in 1911. But cholera is still present in Africa, Southeast Asia, Haiti and central Mexico. The risk of cholera epidemic is highest when poverty, war or natural disasters force people to live in crowded conditions without adequate sanitation.</p>
<p>Cholera is easily treated. Death results from severe dehydration that can be prevented with a simple and inexpensive rehydration solution.</p>



MALIGNANT-PERIPHERAL-NERVE-SHEATH-TUMORS
definition


<p>Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors are a type of cancer that occurs in the protective lining of the nerves that extend from the spinal cord into the body. Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors are also called neurofibrosarcomas.</p>
<p>Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors can occur anywhere in the body, but most often occur in the deep tissue of the arms, legs and trunk. Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors tend to cause pain and weakness in the affected area and may also cause a growing lump or mass.</p>
<p>Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors occur more frequently in people with an inherited condition that causes nerve tumors (neurofibromatosis) and in people who have undergone radiation therapy for cancer. However, most people with malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors have no risk factors for the disease.</p>
<p>Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors are typically treated with surgery. In certain cases, radiation therapy and chemotherapy also may be recommended.</p>



COMPULSIVE-SEXUAL-BEHAVIOR
definition


<p>Compulsive sexual behavior &mdash; sometimes called hypersexuality, hypersexual disorder, nymphomania or sexual addiction &mdash; is an obsession with sexual thoughts, feelings or behaviors that affects your health, job, relationships or other parts of your life. </p>
<p>Compulsive sexual behavior may involve a normally enjoyable sexual experience that becomes an obsession. Or compulsive sexual behavior may involve fantasies or activities outside the bounds of culturally, legally or morally accepted sexual behavior. </p>
<p>No matter what it's called or the exact nature of the behavior, untreated compulsive sexual behavior can damage your self-esteem, relationships, career and other people. But with treatment and self-help, you can manage compulsive sexual behavior and keep your urges in check. </p>



WRIST-PAIN
definition


<p>Wrist pain is a common complaint. Many types of wrist pain are caused by sudden injuries that result in sprains or fractures. But wrist pain also can be caused by more long-term problems &mdash; such as repetitive stress, arthritis and carpal tunnel syndrome. </p>
<p>Because so many factors can lead to wrist pain, diagnosing the exact cause of long-standing wrist pain sometimes can be difficult. An accurate diagnosis is crucial, however, because proper treatment depends on the cause and severity of your wrist pain. </p>

TUBERCULOSIS
definition


<p>Tuberculosis (TB) is a potentially serious infectious disease that mainly affects your lungs. The bacteria that cause tuberculosis are spread from one person to another through tiny droplets released into the air via coughs and sneezes.</p>
<p>Once rare in developed countries, tuberculosis infections began increasing in 1985, partly because of the emergence of HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. HIV weakens a person's immune system so it can't fight the TB germs. In the United States, because of stronger control programs, tuberculosis began to decrease again in 1993, but remains a concern.</p>
<p>Many strains of tuberculosis resist the drugs most used to treat the disease. People with active tuberculosis must take several types of medications for many months to eradicate the infection and prevent development of antibiotic resistance.</p>

RETRACTILE-TESTICLE
definition


<p>A retractile testicle is a testicle that may move back and forth between the scrotum and the groin. When the retractile testicle is residing in the groin, it may be easily guided by hand into its proper position in the scrotum &mdash; the bag of skin hanging behind the penis &mdash; during a physical examination. </p>
<p>For most boys, the problem of a retractile testicle goes away sometime before or during puberty, the time when an out-of-place testicle moves to its correct location in the scrotum and stays there permanently. </p>
<p>About a quarter of the time, the retractile testicle stays up in the groin and is no longer movable. When this happens, the condition is called an ascending testicle. </p>

CRYPTOSPORIDIUM
definition


<p>Cryptosporidium infection (cryptosporidiosis) is an illness caused by tiny cryptosporidium parasites. When cryptosporidia (krip-toe-spoe-RID-e-uh) enter your body, they travel to your small intestine and then burrow into the walls of your intestines. Later, cryptosporidia are shed in your feces.</p>
<p>In most healthy people, a cryptosporidium infection produces a bout of watery diarrhea and the infection usually goes away within a week or two. If you have a compromised immune system, a cryptosporidium infection can become life-threatening without proper treatment.</p>
<p>You can help prevent a cryptosporidium infection by practicing good hygiene and avoiding swallowing water from pools, recreational water parks, lakes and streams.</p>

VENTRICULAR-FIBRILLATION
definition


<p>Ventricular fibrillation is a heart rhythm problem that occurs when the heart beats with rapid, erratic electrical impulses. This causes pumping chambers in your heart (the ventricles) to quiver uselessly, instead of pumping blood. During ventricular fibrillation, your blood pressure plummets, cutting off blood supply to your vital organs. Ventricular fibrillation is frequently triggered by a heart attack. </p>
<p>Ventricular fibrillation is an emergency that requires immediate medical attention. A person with ventricular fibrillation will collapse within seconds and soon won't be breathing or have a pulse. Emergency treatment for ventricular fibrillation includes cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and shocks to the heart with a device called a defibrillator. </p>
<p>Treatments for those at risk of ventricular fibrillation include medications and implantable devices that can restore a normal heart rhythm. </p>



BROKEN-LEG
definition


<p>A broken leg (leg fracture) is a break or crack in one of the bones in your leg. Common causes include falls, motor vehicle accidents and sports injuries.</p>
<p>Treatment of a broken leg depends on the location and severity of the injury. A severely broken leg may require surgery to implant devices into the broken bone to maintain proper alignment during healing. Other injuries may be treated with a cast or splint. In all cases, prompt diagnosis and treatment of a broken leg is critical to complete healing.</p>

<p>Morning sickness is nausea that occurs during pregnancy. Morning sickness is a misnomer, however, since it can strike at any time of the day or night. </p>
<p>Morning sickness affects a large proportion of pregnant women. Morning sickness is most common during the first trimester, but for some women morning sickness lingers throughout pregnancy. Treatment isn't usually needed for morning sickness &mdash; although various home remedies, such as snacking throughout the day and sipping ginger ale, often help relieve nausea. </p>
<p>Rarely, morning sickness is so severe that it's classified as hyperemesis gravidarum. This type of morning sickness may require hospitalization and treatment with intravenous (IV) fluids and medications. </p>

MEN1
definition


<p>Multiple endocrine neoplasia, type 1 (MEN 1), sometimes called Wermer's syndrome, is a rare disorder that causes tumors in the endocrine glands and parts of the small intestine and stomach. In MEN 1, the endocrine glands &mdash; usually the parathyroids, pancreas and pituitary &mdash; grow tumors and release excessive amounts of hormones that can lead to disease. However, the tumors are usually not cancerous (benign).</p>
<p>The excess hormones can cause symptoms such as tiredness, bone pain, fractures and kidney stones, as well as stomach or intestinal ulcers. Although MEN 1 can't be cured, if regular testing detects problems, doctors can provide treatment as needed.</p>
<p>MEN 1 is an inherited disorder, meaning people who have the gene mutation can pass it on to their children. Each child has a 50 percent chance of inheriting the disorder.</p>

<p>Dizziness is a term used to describe everything from feeling faint or lightheaded to feeling weak or unsteady. Dizziness that creates the sense that you or your surroundings are spinning or moving is called vertigo. </p>
<p>Dizziness is one of the most common reasons adults visit their doctors &mdash; right up there with chest pain and fatigue. Although frequent dizzy spells or constant dizziness can keep you from doing much of anything, dizziness rarely signals a serious, life-threatening condition. Treatment of dizziness depends on the cause and your symptoms, but is usually effective. </p>



SOFT-PALATE-CANCER
definition


<p>Soft palate cancer is a type of cancer that begins in the cells of the soft palate. Your soft palate is located on the upper portion of the back of your mouth, behind your teeth.</p>
<p>Soft palate cancer is considered a type of throat cancer. Doctors treat soft palate cancer similarly to the way they treat other types of throat cancers &mdash; often with a combination of surgery, radiation therapy and chemotherapy.</p>



UVEITIS
definition


<p>Uveitis (u-ve-I-tis) is inflammation of the uvea, the middle layer of the eye. The uvea consists of the iris, choroid and ciliary body. The choroid is sandwiched between the retina and the white of the eye (sclera), and it provides blood flow to the deep layers of the retina. The most common type of uveitis is an inflammation of the iris called iritis (anterior uveitis). </p>
<p>Infections, injury and autoimmune disorders may be associated with the development of uveitis, though the exact cause is often unknown. </p>
<p>Uveitis can be serious, leading to permanent vision loss. Early diagnosis and treatment are important to prevent the complications of uveitis.</p>



GOUT
definition


<p>Gout is characterized by sudden, severe attacks of pain, redness and tenderness in joints, often the joint at the base of the big toe. </p>
<p>Gout &mdash; a complex form of arthritis &mdash; can affect anyone. Men are more likely to get gout, but women become increasingly susceptible to gout after menopause. </p>
<p>An acute attack of gout can wake you up in the middle of the night with the sensation that your big toe is on fire. The affected joint is hot, swollen and so tender that even the weight of the sheet on it may seem intolerable. </p>
<p>Fortunately, gout is treatable, and there are ways to reduce the risk that gout will recur. </p>



PEDIATRIC-SLEEP-APNEA

<p>Pediatric obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.org/sleep-disorders/">sleep disorder</a> that occurs when your child's breathing becomes partially or completely blocked repeatedly as your child sleeps. The condition is due to blockage of the upper airway during sleep. Pediatric obstructive sleep apnea usually differs from <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.org/sleep-apnea/">adult sleep apnea</a> in several ways. For example, children often have only partially blocked airways and wake up less during sleep than do adults with sleep apnea. Problems with daytime behavior and attention span are seen in children with OSA.</p>

EATING-DISORDERS
definition


<p>Eating disorders are a group of serious conditions in which you're so preoccupied with food and weight that you can often focus on little else. The main types of eating disorders are anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa and binge-eating disorder.</p>
<p>Eating disorders can cause serious physical problems and, at their most severe, can even be life-threatening. Most people with eating disorders are females, but males can also have eating disorders. An exception is binge-eating disorder, which appears to affect almost as many males as females.</p>
<p>Treatments for eating disorders usually involve psychotherapy, nutrition education, family counseling, medications and hospitalization.</p>



ENLARGED-LIVER

<p>An enlarged liver is one that's bigger than normal. The liver is a large, football-shaped organ found in the upper right portion of your abdomen. The medical term for enlarged liver is hepatomegaly (hep-uh-to-MEG-uh-le). </p>
<p>Enlarged liver isn't a disease. It's a sign of an underlying problem, such as liver disease, congestive heart failure or cancer. </p>
<p>Treatment for enlarged liver involves identifying and controlling the underlying cause of the condition. </p>

<p>Heartburn is a burning pain in your chest, just behind your breastbone. The pain is often worse when lying down or bending over.</p>
<p>Occasional heartburn is common and no cause for alarm. Most people can manage the discomfort of heartburn on their own with lifestyle changes and over-the-counter medications.</p>
<p>Heartburn that is more frequent or interferes with your daily routine may be a symptom of a more serious condition that requires medical care.</p>



TUBEROUS-SCLEROSIS
definition


<p>Tuberous sclerosis (TWO-bur-uhs skluh-ROW-sis) complex is a rare genetic disease that causes noncancerous (benign) lesions to grow in many parts of the body, such as the skin, brain and kidneys. The signs and symptoms of tuberous sclerosis vary &mdash; from patches of light-colored skin to seizures or behavior problems &mdash; depending on where the lesions develop. </p>
<p>Tuberous sclerosis is often detected during infancy or childhood. Some people with tuberous sclerosis have such mild signs and symptoms that the condition isn't diagnosed until adulthood, or it goes undiagnosed. Others experience serious disabilities. </p>
<p>There's no cure for tuberous sclerosis, and there's no way to predict the course or severity of the disease. With appropriate treatment, however, many people who have tuberous sclerosis lead full, productive lives. </p>



TAY-SACHS-DISEASE
definition


<p>Tay-Sachs disease is a rare disorder passed from parents to child. In the most common form, a baby about 6 months old will begin to show symptoms. As the disease progresses, the child's body loses function, leading to blindness, deafness, paralysis and death. That happens because a fatty substance in the child's brain builds up to toxic levels and affects the child's nerve cells. There is no cure for Tay-Sachs disease. Gene therapy research may eventually lead to a cure or treatment to slow the progression of Tay-Sachs disease.</p>
<p>Tay-Sachs disease occurs most frequently among people whose ancestors come from Eastern and Central European Jewish communities (Ashkenazi Jews), from certain French Canadian communities in Quebec, and from the Cajun community of Louisiana. A child who inherits the gene from both parents develops Tay-Sachs disease.</p>
<p>If you have a family history of Tay-Sachs disease or if you're a member of a high-risk group and plan to have children, Mayo Clinic doctors strongly recommend genetic testing and genetic counseling.</p>



STRESS-INCONTINENCE
definition


<p>Urinary incontinence is the unintentional loss of urine. Stress incontinence is prompted by a physical movement or activity &mdash; such as coughing, sneezing, running or heavy lifting &mdash; that puts pressure (stress) on your bladder. Stress incontinence is not related to psychological stress. </p>
<p>Stress incontinence is also different from urge incontinence, which is the unintentional loss of urine caused by the bladder muscle contracting, usually associated with a sense of urgency. Stress incontinence is much more common in women than men. </p>
<p>If you have stress incontinence, you may feel embarrassed, isolate yourself, or limit your work and social life, especially exercise and leisure activities. With treatment, you'll likely be able to manage stress incontinence and improve your overall well-being. </p>



NARCISSISTIC-PERSONALITY-DISORDER
definition


<p>Narcissistic personality disorder is a mental disorder in which people have an inflated sense of their own importance and a deep need for admiration. Those with narcissistic personality disorder believe that they're superior to others and have little regard for other people's feelings. But behind this mask of ultra-confidence lies a fragile self-esteem, vulnerable to the slightest criticism. </p>
<p>Narcissistic personality disorder is one of several types of personality disorders. Personality disorders are conditions in which people have traits that cause them to feel and behave in socially distressing ways, limiting their ability to function in relationships and in other areas of their life, such as work or school. </p>
<p>Narcissistic personality disorder treatment is centered around psychotherapy. </p>



CHONDROSARCOMA

SCHIZOPHRENIA
definition


<p>Schizophrenia is a severe brain disorder in which people interpret reality abnormally. Schizophrenia may result in some combination of hallucinations, delusions, and extremely disordered thinking and behavior.</p>
<p>Contrary to popular belief, schizophrenia isn't a split personality or multiple personality. The word "schizophrenia" does mean "split mind," but it refers to a disruption of the usual balance of emotions and thinking.</p>
<p>Schizophrenia is a chronic condition, requiring lifelong treatment.</p>



ODONTOGENIC-LESIONS
definition


<p>Odontogenic lesions are cysts or tumors that develop in your jawbone or the soft tissues in your mouth. Odontogenic lesions can vary greatly in size and severity. These lesions are usually noncancerous (benign), but they may behave aggressively at times. Treatment generally involves surgical care but may include medical therapy for certain types of lesions.</p>



JELLYFISH-STINGS
definition


<p>Jellyfish stings are relatively common problems for people swimming, wading or diving in seawaters. The long tentacles trailing from the jellyfish body can inject you with venom from thousands of microscopic barbed stingers.</p>
<p>Jellyfish stings vary greatly in severity. Most often they result in immediate pain and red, irritated marks on the skin. Some jellyfish stings may cause more whole-body (systemic) illness. And in rare cases jellyfish stings are life-threatening.</p>
<p>Most jellyfish stings get better with home treatment. Severe reactions require emergency medical care.</p>



MALE-BREAST-CANCER
definition


<p>Male breast cancer is cancer that forms in the breast tissue of men. Though breast cancer is most commonly thought of as a woman's disease, male breast cancer does occur. </p>
<p>Male breast cancer is most common in older men, though male breast cancer can occur at any age. </p>
<p>Men diagnosed with male breast cancer at an early stage have a good chance for a cure. Still, many men delay seeing their doctors if they notice unusual signs or symptoms, such as a breast lump. For this reason, many male breast cancers are diagnosed when the disease is more advanced. </p>



BREAST-PAIN
definition


<p>Breast pain (mastalgia) &mdash; a common complaint among women &mdash; can include breast tenderness, sharp burning pain or tightness in your breast tissue. The pain may be constant or it may occur only occasionally. </p>
<p>Breast pain can range from mild to severe. It can affect you just a few days a month, for instance just before your period, or can last for seven days or more each month. Breast pain may affect you just before your period or it may continue throughout the menstrual cycle. Postmenopausal women sometimes have breast pain, but breast pain is more common in younger, premenopausal women and perimenopausal women. </p>
<p>Most times, breast pain signals a noncancerous (benign) breast condition and rarely indicates breast cancer. Still, unexplained breast pain that doesn't go away after one or two menstrual cycles or that persists after menopause and occurs in one specific area of your breast needs to be evaluated by your doctor. </p>



ANGINA
definition


<p>Angina is a type of chest pain caused by reduced blood flow to the heart muscle. Angina (an-JIE-nuh or AN-juh-nuh) is a symptom of coronary artery disease. Angina is typically described as squeezing, pressure, heaviness, tightness or pain in your chest. </p>
<p>Angina, also called angina pectoris, can be a recurring problem or a sudden, acute health concern. </p>
<p>Angina is relatively common but can be hard to distinguish from other types of chest pain, such as the pain or discomfort of indigestion. If you have unexplained chest pain, seek medical attention right away. </p>



TRICHINOSIS
definition


<p>Trichinosis (trik-ih-NO-sis), sometimes called trichinellosis, is a type of roundworm infection. Roundworms are parasites that use a host body to stay alive and reproduce. Trichinosis occurs primarily among meat-eating animals (carnivores), especially bears, foxes and walruses. Trichinosis infection is acquired by eating larvae in raw or undercooked meat. </p>
<p>When humans eat undercooked meat containing trichinella larvae, the larvae mature into adult worms in the intestine over several weeks. The adults then produce larvae that migrate through various tissues, including muscle. Trichinosis is most widespread in rural areas throughout the world. </p>
<p>Trichinosis can be treated with medication, though it's not always necessary. It's also easy to prevent. </p>
